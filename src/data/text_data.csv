0,"How-To Diagnose an Ingrown Toenail

Common Causes of an Ingrown Toenail
Some of the most common causes of an ingrown toenail include: (4)

Wearing shoes that crowd the toenails, such as heels or any shoes that are too tight (this is the No. 1 risk factor for ingrown toenails, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS))
Cutting toenails too short or not straight across
Injuring the toenail
Having unusually curved toenails
Toe deformities
Subungual exostosis (outgrowth of bone from the tip of the toe)
Use of isotretinoin in the treatment of severe acne

There are many risk factors involved in the development of ingrown nails, such as anatomic and behavioral mechanisms. Some experts suggest that wider nail folds and thinner, flatter nails may increase the risk of ingrown toenails. A case-control study with 46 patients found no difference in the anatomic shape of toenails in patients with and without ingrown toenails. (5)

Repetitive trauma, such as running, kicking or inadvertent trauma like stubbing the toe, may be other ingrown toenail causes. Without any strict evidence basis, it’s thought that a genetic predisposition and family history, hyperhidrosis, and poor foot hygiene increase the likelihood of ingrown toenails. Diabetes, obesity, thyroid, cardiac and renal disorders that may predispose to lower extremity edema can also increase the likelihood.

In adolescence, feet perspire more often, causing the skin and nails to become soft, resulting in easy splitting. This produces nail spicules (sharp points that of the nail) that can pierce the lateral skin. In older persons, spicule formation can become a chronic problem caused by their reduced ability to care for their nails, secondary to reduced mobility or impaired vision. In addition, the natural aging process causes toenails to thicken, making them more difficult to cut and more inclined to exert pressure on the lateral skin at the sides of the nail plate, often becoming ingrown, painful and infected.

According to a 2005 Cochrane Review, rates of regrowth after treatment were 34 percent to 50 percent. In 1959, Vandenbos and Bowers noted that patients who developed this nail problem tend to have an excessive amount of tissue at the sides of the affected nail. They theorized that weight-bearing caused the tissue to bulge over the sides of the nail, which can result in the growth of the toenail into the skin. (6)

I want to note that an ingrown fingernail is similar in terms of how it happens. The usual causes of ingrown fingernails are due to improper trimming of the nail, an injury and even nail biting. And, like the toenail, sometimes the natural shape or thickness of the nail can make it more susceptible to becoming ingrown. (7)

Whatever the cause, and regardless as to whether it’s an ingrown toenail or ingrown fingernail, it can be incredibly annoying to excruciatingly painful. And if left untreated, it can become infected.

By avoiding or minimizing some of these risk factors, it may be possible to prevent ingrown toenails.

Medical Treatment of Ingrown Toenails
Once your ingrown toenail has progressed past the first stage, you may need to seek medical help. There are various surgical treatments of ingrown toenails your podiatrist may recommend. All of these are standard, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS).

Wedge Resection: This involves the partial removal of the nail or a portion of it, after numbing your toe with a local anesthetic and draining any ingrown toenail infection. Your doctor can perform this procedure in the office and the recovery time is anywhere between two weeks to two months, depending on the size of the nail portion removed.

Matrixectomy: The matrixectomy procedure is also referred to as permanent or full nail avulsion. Unlike typical avulsions, which aren’t often practiced anymore (they often result in further issues), a matrixectomy happens when the physician removes the entire nail from your nail bed and then covers the nail matrix (the tissue beneath your nail) with a chemical that stops it from ever growing back.

Vandenbos Procedure: The Vandenbos procedure has been around since the late 1950s and involves removal of the skin directly underneath and on either side of the ingrown toenail. Recovery is longer with this procedure, but this is also the only procedure in which a doctor does not need to prescribe antibiotics for prevention of infections. It also seems to be the procedure most likely to prevent recurrences of ingrown nails.

Risks, Complications and Things You Should Know About Ingrown Toenails
It’s also important to note that if you have diabetes or another condition that causes poor blood flow to your feet, you’re at greater risk of complications of ingrown toenails. (8) That’s just another reason to treat your diabetes.

Left untreated or undetected, an ingrown toenail can infect the underlying bone and lead to a serious bone infection. Complications can be especially severe if you have diabetes, which can cause poor blood flow and damage nerves in your feet. So a minor foot injury — a cut, scrape, corn, callus or ingrown toenail — may not heal properly and become infected.

A difficult-to-heal open sore (foot ulcer) may require surgery to prevent the decay and death of tissue (gangrene). Gangrene results from an interruption in blood flow to an area of your body. (9)",1
1,"How To Be a Basically Healthy Person

By Alexandra Sifferlin June 13, 2016

Even if we have the best of intentions, the goals we set to get healthy (after this last slice of pizza, of course) sometimes fall by the wayside. It can be hard to stay motivated, or even properly informed, since the recommendations for what to eat and how long to exercise can be confusing and conflicting. (Fat, for example, was off the menu for years under official guidance that eating fat makes you fat, and now that advice is getting kicked to the curb.) As a result, truly healthy behaviors can have a hard time cutting through the noise. Despite everything we know about the health benefits of exercise, a recent study found that 43% of employed adults do not exercise often.
Yet getting healthier is still a worthy goal, and many experts in the fields of exercise, health and nutrition have clear ideas about how to get there. Here are some low-stress, bare-minimum ways to become a healthier person, even for those of us who love to eat and hit snooze.

How to eat
Eating healthy shouldn’t be a nutrient numbers game. And no: you don’t have to go vegan or adopt a Paleo diet. Just make sure your plate contains more than two different colors, says Simin Nikbin Meydani, director of the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. “If it’s not, it’s boring, and you won’t meet your nutrient requirements,” she says. “If it’s green and red and brown, you can.”
After coloring your plate, make sure to consume it—and enjoy it—with someone else. “Sharing a meal with friends and family impacts our health and how we age and fare as we get older,” Meydani says.
Some countries, like Brazil, follow just that advice. Their government recommends eating whole foods, avoiding processed ones and dining with other people.

How to exercise
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that American adults do two hours and 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week, plus some muscle-strengthening on the side.
Many people don’t do any of that. A 2015 study published in the The BMJ argued that older adults, especially, find it hard to meet that government advice. “Getting inactive people to do a little bit of physical activity, even if they don’t meet the recommendations, might provide greater population health gains,” wrote study author Philipe de Souto Barreto, a researcher at University Hospital of Toulouse, in the paper.
Yet new evidence suggests they don’t need to. Barreto points out that a study of more than 250,000 older adults found that getting less than an hour of moderate physical activity each week was linked to a 15% drop in death, which means that people do benefit from even a small amount of exercise. Studies have also shown significant health benefits from simple exercises like walking.
Some researchers are seeing how low people can go when it comes to time spent working out. Enter the one-minute workout, where you work out as hard as possible for 60 seconds, with some warm-up and cool-down exercises thrown in, too. Even though the time spent exercising is minimal, it’s meant to be hard, and is shown to improve health and fitness. “There might be time-efficient ways to get fit,” says Martin Gibala, chair of kinesiology at McMaster University in Canada. “The notion of meeting people in the middle is positive—but there’s no free lunch.”

The takeaway
Stressing out over meeting government numbers—whether for nutrient values of the number of exercise minutes—may not be worth the headache. Getting some exercise every week and eating colorful meals with friends can be an enjoyable way to live a healthier life. Doing something, it seems, is what’s important.",2
2,"Mods/Installing mods using ModLoader
Before the player decide to modify their copy of Minecraft, it is very important to understand what they are doing or they may end up messing up with the copy. (If your copy of Minecraft is compromised, you can always backup your worlds and re-download Minecraft) If you mod Minecraft, you may break your copy of the game as well as any worlds that you play in. Because you are doing something that is wholly unsupported by Mojang, they won't be able to help you.

Due to how modding works, updating the Minecraft client will break your mods. That is, with each update of the Minecraft client, you will have to obtain updated mods and re-install them. However, the worlds you created will not be destroyed (although any mod items in your world will not be present).

Additionally, the authors of the mod make no guarantees as to whether or not the code works, much less any guarantees of support.

Nearly all mod packs have auto-installers that make adding mods to Minecraft extremely easy for the beginner Modder. You can search for mod packs on the Mods page.

Installation Tools and Prerequisites
Before installing any mod, read the entire description provided by the mod author, as these will sometimes contain special instructions necessary to ensure the mod installs correctly. Further, be aware that while installing mods, certain combinations will present conflicts, which is what occurs when a mod does not work well with another mod due to overwrites or edits that are incompatible. Mod authors will sometimes include specific mods that have known conflicts in their descriptions, but generally common sense may be utilized, for example, a texture mod will likely conflict with another texture mod that edits the same objects. If you experience a bug and have determined that it is unique to your mod setup, it is recommended to submit a detailed bug report to the author of the mod.

Mods typically come packed in compressed files, which means you will need a tool to handle these files such as WinRAR, 7-Zip, or another equivalent tool. Alternatively, Forge or MCPatcher are installation tools that can assist with the installation process.

If your copy of Minecraft breaks, then you should seek help from somebody in the modding community (preferably the mod author).

How Mods Work
A .jar file on the versions folder under .minecraft provides everything Minecraft needs to be able to run. When you add mods to Minecraft, you are taking the .jar file and over-writing it with the changes needed. All of these files inside run through a process called obfuscation.

Furthermore, everything in the game (mobs, items, blocks, etc.) has an ID which allows the game to differentiate each of them. As new content is added to Minecraft, new IDs are used.

This is fundamentally changing the way Minecraft was meant to be played. So Mojang will not be able to help you in any way, and are not responsible for crashes, data loss, etc.
Some mods might claim to do something, but could in fact have been authored with a malicious intent such as stealing your Minecraft username/password, or install a keylogger. This is only a concern if:
The mod that you download contains an executable and you run it.
The mod that you download informs you that you should modify the Minecraft launcher.
If the mod that you wish to install involves neither of these actions then you should feel quite secure. If not, a good measure of safety is to only install mods from a secure and safe website. Make sure to read the comments on mod posts before downloading and installing.",3
3,"Your brain needs a fitness plan

Life expectancy has increased, but our brains aren’t keeping up


This article is reprinted by permission from NextAvenue.org.

The basics of heart health have been drilled into our brains: Eat less saturated fat. Keep moving. Know your “numbers” for cholesterol, blood pressure and BMI.

But what about that brain itself? Although life expectancy has more than doubled since 1900, our “mindspan” — how long we stay cognitively healthy — hasn’t kept pace.

Forgetfulness, slower processing and feeling less sharp plague most of us as we age. One in five people develops mild cognitive impairment, a decline in thinking skills beyond normal aging, which may or may not advance to dementia. After 65, your odds of developing Alzheimer’s disease are one in 10.

It doesn’t have to be that way, mounting research suggests.

“The very term ‘age-related memory loss’ may be a misnomer,” says neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, an Alzheimer’s specialist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York.

Time and genetics alone don’t erode brain functions. How we spend our lives managing the modifiable risk factors that affect our genes is highly significant for our brain health, researchers say.

That’s why you’re likely to hear a lot more in the coming years about brain health and what you can do for your own. Educating the public on this is, in fact, one of the four core purposes of the Centers for Disease Control’s Healthy Brain Initiative, which recently kicked off its 2018-2023 road map for public health agencies, says program leader Lisa McGuire.


Brain health: stop thinking there’s nothing you can do
“Awareness of the steps to improve cognitive brain function is at least a generation behind that of heart health,” says cognitive neuroscientist Sandra Bond Chapman, director of the Center for Brain Health at the University of Texas at Dallas.

When our fathers and grandparents died of a heart attack or stroke, we chalked it up to tragic luck. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol were considered normal features of aging before 1948, when Congress commissioned researchers to begin tracking the cardiovascular lives of some 5,200 residents of Framingham, Mass.

The Framingham Heart Study (now three generations old and still going) introduced the phrase “risk factors” to the medical lexicon and helped prove which prevention tactics work.

You might like: These simple lifestyle changes can prevent or slow Alzheimer’s

Today, it’s the brain we’re in the dark about. In a review of public awareness studies by PLOS One, a nonprofit, peer-reviewed, online scientific journal, nearly half of the respondents mistakenly believed Alzheimer’s disease is a normal process of aging that you can’t do anything about. In reality, a third or more of dementia cases can be delayed or prevented by lifestyle factors, according to a 2017 report sponsored by the Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention and Care.

Read on to find out what we can do to help our brains stay in shape.


Use brain health to motivate your health habits
Advances in neuroimaging kicked off this new era of brain health by allowing scientists to see inside the brain. Intervention studies on how lifestyle affects brain function are newer still.

One of the largest such investigations to date, the BrainHealth Project, launched in December. Researchers across more than a dozen institutions will study 120,000 subjects to find out how cognitive training, sleep, nutrition, exercise and more can extend mental strength over time.

What’s already clear: All health roads lead to the brain. “The No. 1 cause of cognitive decline is healthy people letting their brains decline,” says Chapman, the BrainHealth Project’s director.

Also read: Avoid these 7 exercises if you’re over 50

That’s powerful motivation the next time you’re tempted to skip a workout or not opt for a healthy meal, do nothing about stress or loneliness, or avoid treatment for conditions like depression, anxiety, diabetes and sleep apnea. Effects of all of these choices, and many others, travel north.


Resist too much habit and routine
A particular challenge from midlife and beyond is the brain’s natural inclination to steer toward efficiency. It figures out the easiest, most comfortable ways to get something done and hits repeat.

But while toweling dry in the same mechanical pattern every morning allows you to get on with the day quickly, running your whole life as a creature of habit — doing the same things, seeing the same people — deprives the brain of something else it craves: newness and challenge.

Hallmarks of brain-stimulating activities that improve cognitive abilities, according to a 2017 report by the Global Council on Brain Health (GCBH) are novelty, high engagement, mental challenge and enjoyableness.

If you like crosswords, fine, but push beyond to new games and challenges. Good examples from the GCBH: Tai chi, researching genealogy, picking up an old hobby you dropped, making art and community volunteering. When activities include a social component, so much the better.
Be aggressive about blood pressure

In 2018, a groundbreaking study became the latest persuasive link between heart health and brain health. Researchers at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., showed for the first time that lowering blood pressure can significantly reduce the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

Standard medical care had long included a systolic blood pressure of above 140 as the target defining hypertension and requiring treatment. (Systolic pressure is the first number in a blood pressure reading, as in “140 over 80.”) In 2017, that definition was revised to 130 by the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology.

The recent, long-term, large-scale SPRINT-MIND clinical trial, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, found that the more aggressively high blood pressure was treated toward reaching a systolic pressure below 120, the lower the risk of MCI. Treatment measures included a combination of not smoking, medication management, nutrition counseling, social and cognitive stimulation and exercise.


Work your brain harder, but not by multitasking.
Your brain grooves on doing — but only one thing at a time. Multitasking stresses it.

Researchers say one better alternative is a cognitive exercise called “strategic attention.” The Strategic Memory Advanced Reasoning Training program at the University of Texas at Dallas, advises this: Every day, pick two substantial tasks requiring fairly deep thinking. They might be tracking and analyzing your household budget, planning a vacation, writing a memo or following a complex new recipe.

Then carve out two 30-minute sessions to focus without interruption. Turn off email alerts. Shut the door. No quick scrolls through your news feed that will take you off your task. It takes up to 20 minutes to refocus after a disruption.

Over time, you’ll find that you’ll achieve much more, and much more quickly, with improved attention. It’s the equivalent to your brain of a good workout at the gym.

It’s not all about activity. The brain needs two kinds of downtime to function optimally: Rest and sleep.

Rest means taking intentional breaks from active thinking. Try taking five minutes, five times a day, to sit still and do nothing, Chapman says. Other routes to mental R&R include mindfulness, meditation and yoga nidra (also known as iRest and sleep yoga).

Not least, there’s sleep itself. Our awareness of how important it is to the brain grew with the discovery of the body’s glymphatic system — a kind of internal trash-hauling system — less than a decade ago. The system’s pace increases by over 60% during sleep, a possible link to why getting more sleep is linked with a reduced dementia risk. Alzheimer’s prevention experts recommend eight to nine hours a night, Isaacson says.",4
4,"Google is making it easier for AI developers to keep users’ data private
The company’s new TensorFlow Privacy module lets devs safeguard data with differential privacy

Google has announced a new module for its machine learning framework, TensorFlow, that lets developers improve the privacy of their AI models with just a few lines of extra code.

TensorFlow is one of the most popular tools for building machine learning applications, and it’s used by developers around the world to create programs like text, audio, and image recognition algorithms. With the introduction of TensorFlow Privacy, these developers will be able to safeguard users’ data with a statistical technique known as “differential privacy.”

PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT WHEN AI TOOLS VACUUM UP DATA
Introducing this tool is in keeping with Google’s principles for responsible AI development, Google product manager Carey Radebaugh tells The Verge. “If we don’t get something like differential privacy into TensorFlow, then we just know it won’t be as easy for teams inside and outside of Google to make use of it,” says Radebaugh. “So for us it’s important to get it into TensorFlow, to open source it, and to start to create this community around it.”

The mechanics of differential privacy are somewhat complex, but it is essentially a mathematical approach that means AI models trained on user data can’t encode personally identifiable information. It’s a common way to safeguard the personal information needed to create in AI models: Apple introduced it for its own AI services with iOS 10, and Google uses it for a number of its own AI features like Gmail’s Smart Reply.

To understand the dangers to privacy posed by these sorts of services, consider how Smart Reply relies on data collected from more than a billion Gmail users to make its suggested replies. This data obviously includes extremely personal information (basically anything you’ve ever put in an email), and if Smart Reply surfaced this, by, for example, suggesting a reply to an email that is word-for-word what another user wrote, it would be disastrous.

Differential privacy eliminates this possibility with “mathematical certainty,” says Úlfar Erlingsson, a research scientist at Google who’s been working in the field of data privacy for 20 years. It’s a technique that removes identifiable outliers from datasets without changing the aggregate meaning of that data, Erlingsson tells The Verge. “You have an outcome that is independent of any one person’s [data] but that is still a good outcome.”

There are some downsides to using differential privacy, though. “By masking outliers, it can sometimes remove relevant or interesting data, especially in varied datasets, like those involving language,” says Erlingsson. “Differential privacy literally means that it’s impossible for the system to learn about anything that happens just once in the dataset, and so you have this tension. Do you have to go get more data of a certain type? How relevant or useful are those unique properties in the dataset?”

But Google hopes that by releasing TensorFlow Privacy, more AI developers around the world will start using this technique, and these problems can be ameliorated. “There’s work to do to make it easier to figure out this tradeoff,” says Radebaugh.

Ultimately, says Google, it’s better to have more brains involved, and releasing new open-source tools increases the pool of available talent. Plus, being able to add differential privacy to an AI model using just “four or five lines [of code] and some hyper-parameter tuning” is a big step forward in its own right, says Erlingsson. “This is a very different sort of world to what we were in even just a few months ago, so we’re quite proud of that.”",5
5,"The Truth About Fats And Why They Are Extremely Important For You
Carbohydrates, proteins and fats are the three macronutrients required by the body. It is the combination of these three that provide the body with optimum energy, strength and stamina.

If you have lived with the belief that you need to cut down fats to lose weight, then you have been extremely wrong! Fats are an important of your daily nutrient intake and cutting them off from your diet can result in nutritional deficiencies. There are some vitamins which are fat soluble: means that they can be assimilated by the body in the presence of some essential fats. Vitamins A, D, E and K are instances of fat soluble vitamins. Nutritionist Nmami Agarwal, shares a post on Instagram talking about the importance of fats for living healthy.
In her blog post (shared on Instagram) Nmami writes that carbohydrates, proteins and fats are the three macronutrients required by the body. It is the combination of these three that provide the body with optimum energy, strength and stamina.

Good fats and bad fats
The numerous misconceptions that exists regarding fats is probably because of the bad fats (as they are called). Nmami explains that bad fats are the ones which contribute to increase in cholesterol levels. These fats have the capability to clog arteries, increase blood pressure and risks of heart diseases and atherosclerosis. Saturated fats and trans fats are bad fats. Foods like palm oil, cream, butter, cheese and full fat milk contain bad fats.
Coming over to the good fats, they are the ones which come in unsaturated form. Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are the two kinds of good fats. Omega 3 fatty acids and omega 6 fatty acids come under the PUFA category. Foods like avocado, walnuts, legumes, soy, flaxseeds and olive oil are all considered as good fats.

Benefits of including fats in your diet:
1. Absorption of vitamins: As mentioned above, the body needs fats for absorption of fat soluble vitamins - Vitamin A, D, E and K. Vitamin A is important for eye health. It helps in keeping the skin moisturised and promotes faster healing. Vitamin D is required for bone health and absorption of calcium. Vitamin E is a antioxidant important for skin and hair health. Vitamin K too is needed for bone health, and also for proper healing of wounds.
2. Fats provide you energy: Optimum amount of fats are needed by the body to live an active lifestyle and perform physical activity efficiently.
3. Fats regulate body temperature: Fat cells are stored within adipose tissues. These are responsible for providing the body with insulation. They help in maintaining body temperature. Moreover, fats protect vital organs of the body from external injury or trauma.
4. Fats protect nerve tissues: Fatty acids facilitate growth of nerve cells or neurons in the body. Lack of essential fatty acids can increase risks of multiple sclerosis, informs Nmami.
5. Fats are important for brain health: 60% of your brain is made up of fat. Fatty acids like omega 3 fatty acids are required by the body for proper functioning of the brain and memory retention. Intake of the right kind of fat is important for your health and overall wellbeing.

6,"How to Setup Your Own Personal Cloud Storage

For those folks who don’t trust their data in the cloud, the best storage solution is usually local, meaning either an external hard drive or a computer. The advantage to this solution is that you don’t have to pay any money to store your data (other than purchasing the drives) and you don’t have to worry about someone else being able to get into your data (for the most part).

However, there are several disadvantages to storing everything locally on internal and external hard drives. Firstly, unless you have a good backup solution in place, you are more at risk of losing your data. Cloud storage companies have many redundant layers of backup to protect all your data.

Secondly, it can be really difficult and frustrating to access data stored on a single external hard drive from anywhere in the world on any device. Cloud storage services usually make this really easy by having desktop apps and mobile apps for accessing data.

If you want the advantages of cloud storage, but the security of having everything locally stored, you should consider setting up personal cloud storage. Again, you’ll get all the mobile and desktop apps and everything will be synced, but you’ll have the data stored locally on your own devices.

Again, you’ll have no monthly fees to worry about, but you’ll have a higher up-front cost. Personal cloud storage is also really good for anyone who has terabytes of data they need to store, but don’t want to pay the hefty monthly costs associated with anything over 1 TB. For example, after the 1 TB plan on Google Drive, it skips to 10 TB and you have to spend $99 a month.

With OneDrive, you can only add more space after 1 TB in 50 GB increments. Each 50 GB increment costs $1.99. To get to 10 TB, you’d have to pay a whopping $360 a month! With Dropbox, you can only get a max of 1 TB with a Pro account. If you want more than that, you need to become a business customer with at least 5 users.

Understanding Network Hard Drives
So what do you need to buy in order to get your own cloud storage setup? Well, you’re basically buying a network attached storage device or NAS. Note that a NAS device is slightly different than a network hard drive.

In my view, a network hard drive is a single hard drive inside a device that connects to the network and provides a web interface to control and access data. A NAS has multiple hard drives that can be configured in a RAID array, thereby providing in-built data protection.

I recommend staying away from single network hard drive solutions because it’s pretty much the same thing as using a regular external hard drive, except you get all the cloud features. However, if the drive fails, you lose all your data, which may or may not be duplicated somewhere else.

For example, if you consider the WD My Cloud Personal NAS, the single drive is really just a network hard drive. If you get the dual drive version, then it can be considered a NAS in my opinion.

As you can see, though, you can get 8 TB worth of storage for about $400, which is not bad at all. Of course, there is one caveat to consider. The reason I suggest a NAS device with two or more hard drives is for data protection. If you put your drives into a RAID array, one drive can fail and you won’t lose any data.

All of the devices mentioned here support RAID on the NAS devices and it’s actually really easy to setup. The only issue is that you lose some available space. For example, if you take the 8 TB NAS above and use RAID 1, you’ll only have 4 TB of free space. If you use RAID 5, you’ll need at least 3 drives, but will get two-thirds of the total space of all three drives.

Considering you can get a dual drive 16 TB NAS for around $750, even being left with 8 TB is probably way more than enough for even creative professionals.

Other Benefits of a NAS

Beyond the personal cloud benefits and being able to sync your data across all your different devices, NAS devices provide a lot of other benefits. Not every device I mention below supports all of these features, except for Synolgy, so be sure to check the features on the device you are considering.

Data protection when using a mutli-bay NAS with RAID
Ability to locally and remotely stream videos from NAS to games consoles, set-top boxes, smartphones and tablets
Ability to connect IP cameras to NAS for video surveillance and recordings
Ability to backup local computers (Windows, Mac, Linux) to the NAS
Ability to backup entire NAS to online cloud storage services like Amazon S3, Glacier, etc.
Ability to use your NAS a FTP server, web server, mail server, etc. with the use of apps
Ability to share files and folders easily with anyone
As you can see, the benefits of having a NAS are much more than just having your own personal cloud storage. You can do a lot with these devices, which makes the up-front cost more bearable.

Personal Cloud Storage Solutions
So which NAS should you get? Well, when it comes to cloud storage, what you are really looking for is great software. All the major hard drive vendors have NAS devices with some sort of personal cloud option, but only a few work really well and have a suite of apps to manage the cloud data.

Synology
I personally have a WD My Cloud EX2 Ultra and a Synology DS 411+II and I find the Synology to be an absolutely amazing device. My Synology NAS is several years old, but can still be updated to the latest version of DSM (DiskStation Manager). The software running on the NAS is excellent and is almost like using Windows.",7
7,"Exclusive: Google's Duplex could make Assistant the most lifelike AI yet

This could be the next evolution of the Assistant, Google's rival to Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana. It sounds remarkably -- maybe even eerily -- human, pausing before responding to questions and using verbal tics, like ""um"" and ""uh."" It says ""mm hmm"" as if it's nodding in agreement. It elongates certain words as though it's buying time to think of an answer, even though its responses are instantaneously programmed by algorithms.

With this new speaking ability, Google Assistant gets that much closer to hitting a milestone in the evolution of computing: passing the Turing test. Proposed by English computer scientist Alan Turing in 1950, it's a way of potentially evaluating a machine's ability to demonstrate intelligent behavior. To pass the Turing test, a computer's natural language responses would have to sound just like a human's.

Built with technology Google calls ""Duplex"" -- and developed by engineers and product designers in Tel Aviv, New York and Mountain View -- the AI sounds as though the future of voice assistants has arrived.

Well, almost arrived.


So far, Google's helper -- and honestly, Alexa, Siri and Cortana, too -- haven't lived up to their promise.

""We're still developing this technology, and we're actually working hard to get this right,"" Pichai said in Tuesday's keynote presentation at Google I/O. ""We have many of these examples when the calls don't quite go as expected. But the Assistant knows the context and nuance. It knew to ask for wait times in this case, and it handled the interaction gracefully.""

If Google ever decides to expand the Duplex technology to Google Home and other consumer-facing products, that could change. Based on the short conversations I heard, it could feel like you're talking to an administrative assistant at the office or maybe even Samantha, the OS from the Spike Jonze movie Her.

Of course, Google wasn't the first to the assistant market. Amazon, in a coup, surprised the world in 2014 when it released its Echo smart speaker, given voice by its Alexa software. For right now, smart speakers remain the best-known way to interact with a digital helper, and Amazon owns 69 percent of the market in the US. Google Home, released in 2016, has 31 percent, according to CIRP, a research firm.

Both Google and Amazon have been beefing up their product lines. Last year, Google introduced the $40 Home Mini and $400 Home Max, with high-end audio. Amazon has 10 Echo products, ranging in price from $40 to $230. Apple joined the battle in February with the $350 HomePod.

But there's potentially bigger money to made when digital assistants connect with the internet of things -- controlling everything from your car's dashboard to your washing machine to your light switches. People will spend $1 trillion on the internet of things by 2020, according to Gartner.

That's why Google has been working hard to catch up. Today, the company announced that 500 million devices have shipped globally with the Assistant on them, including speakers, phones and TVs. Google also said the Assistant can speak in 30 languages and will be in 80 countries by the end of the year, including seven new ones: Denmark, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden. Amazon's Echo is also available in more than 80 countries.

And last week, Google said the Assistant now partners with 5,000 connected household devices, up from 1,500 in January. That's an improvement, but still less than half of the 12,000 Alexa-enabled devices.

Google's Fox tries to downplay to the rivalry with Amazon.

""We think of it less in a competitive way,"" Fox says. ""The bigger opportunity is for people who aren't using anything yet.""

Still, both tech giants haven't been afraid to play hardball and undercut each other for smart home sales. Google in January cut off Amazon Echo and Fire TV access to YouTube, which it owns. Amazon won't sell some gadgets made by Google and Nest, the smart home maker Google bought in 2014.

'We don't know all the answers'
Google has been working on its new natural-sounding voice technology ""for years,"" says Matias, who leads the R&D center in Tel Aviv. The company says Duplex isn't broad AI technology for your phone. Instead, it's geared to specific tasks (like booking reservations, for starters). Matias readily admits that the tech isn't perfect and that Google is moving carefully because there are lots of thorny issues that come with a more human-sounding AI.

Like, what happens if the software starts talking nonsense? Matias tells me the tech won't go rogue and leave a trail of confused small-business owners talking to robots. When the feature actually rolls out, he says, the software will likely tell the person on the other end of the line that he or she is talking to a digital assistant -- even though the Assistant didn't do that during the recordings I heard.

""We need to be thoughtful about how we have this interaction while we're experimenting with it,"" Matias says. ""We believe it's right to do this with transparency.""

If a conversation does go awry, the software will fall back on what he calls ""real-time supervised training."" In that scenario, the software would turn over the conversation to a human to finish the call. Because calls aren't normally monitored by people, they'd have to begin from scratch. Google wouldn't say whether that person would have a log of what's already been discussed on the call.

The Duplex technology is the stuff of sci-fi. And that raises questions, both practical and philosophical: How should a person treat a lifelike AI? What's the proper human-robot etiquette or does that need to be developed? What's the best way for an AI to reveal it's a robot when talking to a human -- without disrupting the flow of a conversation?

Asked about these issues, Fox acknowledged that the folks at Google are learning about these things as they go.",8
8,"How to Do CPR

There is no substitute for learning cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but emergencies don't wait for training. The steps below include rescue breathing. Only try that if you are trained and confident with the skill. If you're hesitant or if you've never been trained in CPR, use hands-only CPR.

These steps are for adults. For kids 1-8 years old, follow Child CPR.

Determine if the patient needs CPR before you start it. Follow these steps:

Shake and Shout. Grasp the patient by the shoulders and shake briskly. Shout ""Wake up!"" and the patient's name if you know it. Shake and shout for a few seconds, but don't spend too much time.
Call 911. Anytime a patient won't wake up, call 911 immediately. Get help on the way as fast as you can.
Check for Breathing. Tilt the patient's head back and look for breathing. If the patient doesn't take a breath in less than 10 seconds, start CPR.
Don't spend a lot of time trying to wake the patient. If it doesn't work with five seconds of trying, move on. You can't hurt the patient with CPR, but if the patient needs CPR and you don't do it, the patient will die.


Start CPR
Push on the Chest. Imagine a line between the nipples and put your hands on the center of the chest right below that line. Push hard and fast—about twice per second.
Rescue Breaths. If you have had CPR training and feel comfortable performing the steps, push on the chest 30 times then give 2 rescue breaths. Repeat cycles of 30 chest compressions and 2 breaths until help arrives or the patient wakes up.
If you have not had CPR training or don't feel comfortable giving rescue breaths, just keep pushing on the chest until help arrives.


What Each Step Does
If you have a patient in front of you and you're saving a life, ignore this section until later. If, on the other hand, you'd like to know why you do each step, read on.

Shaking and Shouting

The idea is to try the least invasive treatment for the patient before moving on to something more aggressive. Shaking and shouting went out of favor for a while due to concern about neck injuries. The reality is that neck injuries are both very uncommon and very unlikely to be aggravated by this maneuver.

Try a quick shake and shout, but don't let this step get in the way of the more important steps. If the patient isn't responding, call 911. If the patient wakes up, but is confused or not able to speak, call 911.

Calling 911

Whenever you have an unconscious adult patient, the ambulance is the first thing you want on the way. Even before starting CPR, you need to call 911 and get help started your way. Without an ambulance to get the patient and transport him to the right hospital, None of the stuff on this list will help much.

Follow the instructions given by the dispatcher on the other end of the phone (if they do give you instructions). If they don't provide instructions, follow the steps listed above.

Chest Compressions

Compressing the chest moves blood through the brain, keeping it alive until the heart can get started again. It's really important to keep the blood flowing without interruption. Any delay in pushing on the chest (or any pause of more than a few seconds) also significantly affects how well blood flows.

Almost as important as how deep and how fast you compress the chest, releasing the chest after each push is also critical. Your hands shouldn't bounce, but you should lift your entire body weight off the patient in between each compression.

Chest compressions are extremely important. If you are not comfortable giving rescue breaths, still perform chest compressions! It's called Hands Only CPR.  No matter what, keep going until help arrives or the patient wakes up and tells you to stop.

Rescue Breathing

Rescue breathing has become one of the most controversial steps in CPR. The debate is ongoing about how much is enough (or too much) and whether it's even necessary.

If you do perform rescue breaths, make sure you know how to do it right. See this reminder on how to do mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing.

Get Trained

This is not a substitute for actual CPR training. Find a CPR class and get proper training.

Not every CPR class is the same. There are CPR classes for healthcare professionals as well as CPR classes for the layperson. Before you take a CPR class, make sure the class is right for you.

9,"Wi-Fi 6: is it really that much faster?

Wi-Fi is about to get faster. That’s great news: faster internet is constantly in demand, especially as we consume more bandwidth-demanding apps, games, and videos with our laptops and phones.

But the next generation of Wi-Fi, known as Wi-Fi 6, isn’t just a simple speed boost. Its impact will be more nuanced, and we’re likely to see its benefits more and more over time.

This is less of a one-time speed increase and more of a future-facing upgrade designed to make sure our speeds don’t grind to a halt a few years down the road.

Wi-Fi 6 is just starting to arrive this year, and there’s a good chance it’ll be inside your next phone or laptop. Here’s what you should expect once it arrives.

WHAT IS WI-FI 6?
Wi-Fi 6 is the next generation of Wi-Fi. It’ll still do the same basic thing — connect you to the internet — just with a bunch of additional technologies to make that happen more efficiently, speeding up connections in the process.

HOW FAST IS IT?
The short but incomplete answer: 9.6 Gbps. That’s up from 3.5 Gbps on Wi-Fi 5.

The real answer: both of those speeds are theoretical maximums that you’re unlikely to ever reach in real-world Wi-Fi use. And even if you could reach those speeds, it’s not clear that you’d need them. The typical download speed in the US is just 72 Mbps, or less than 1 percent of the theoretical maximum speed.

But the fact that Wi-Fi 6 has a much higher theoretical speed limit than its predecessor is still important. That 9.6 Gbps doesn’t have to go to a single computer. It can be split up across a whole network of devices. That means more potential speed for each device.
WI-FI 6 ISN’T ABOUT TOP SPEEDS
Instead of boosting the speed for individual devices, Wi-Fi 6 is all about improving the network when a bunch of devices are connected.

That’s an important goal, and it arrives at an important time: when Wi-Fi 5 came out, the average US household had about five Wi-Fi devices in it. Now, homes have nine Wi-Fi devices on average, and various firms have predicted we’ll hit 50 on average within several years.

Those added devices take a toll on your network. Your router can only communicate with so many devices at once, so the more gadgets demanding Wi-Fi, the more the network overall is going to slow down.

Wi-Fi 6 introduces some new technologies to help mitigate the issues that come with putting dozens of Wi-Fi devices on a single network. It lets routers communicate with more devices at once, lets routers send data to multiple devices in the same broadcast, and lets Wi-Fi devices schedule check-ins with the router. Together, those features should keep connections strong even as more and more devices start demanding data.

DEVICES ARE MORE LIKELY TO MAINTAIN FAST SPEEDS ON BUSY NETWORKS
Where current routers might start to get overwhelmed by requests from a multitude of devices, Wi-Fi 6 routers are designed to more effectively keep all those devices up to date with the data they need.

Each of those devices’ speeds won’t necessarily be faster than what they can reach today on a high-quality network, but they’re more likely to maintain those top speeds even in busier environments. You can imagine this being useful in a home where one person is streaming Netflix, another is playing a game, someone else is video chatting, and a whole bunch of smart gadgets — a door lock, temperature sensors, light switches, and so on — are all checking in at once.

The top speeds of those devices won’t necessarily be boosted, but the speeds you see in typical, daily use likely will get an upgrade.

Exactly how fast that upgrade is, though, will depend on how many devices are on your network and just how demanding those devices are.",10
10,"The Danger of Diabetic Ketoacidosis

DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS is a dangerous complication for people with diabetes. DKA occurs when the body lacks insulin for too long, causing blood sugar to spike. DKA can quickly become a medical emergency. Fortunately, DKA responds to prompt treatment.

DKA is preventable. Keeping blood sugar under control is the challenge. For people with Type 1 diabetes, in particular, staying on top of insulin regimens, whether through multiple daily injections or an insulin pump, is vital.

However, rising insulin costs and shifting insurance coverage make it harder. Between 2012 and 2016, the price of common insulin products nearly doubled, according to a January 2019 report from the Health Care Cost Institute.

Average point-of-sales prices for insulin rose from 13 cents to 25 cents per unit. ""That translates to an increase of $7.80 a day in 2012, to $15 a day in 2016 for someone using an average amount of insulin,"" according to HCCI figures.

This week, Congress opened hearings on expensive prescription drugs, including remarks from lawmakers on spiking insulin prices forcing patients to risk their health by rationing insulin.

What Causes Diabetic Ketoacidosis?

When the body has too little of the hormone insulin, blood sugar rises far above normal as the body loses its ability to use sugar for energy. In ketoacidosis, the body becomes acidic as it instead uses fat for energy, causing acids called ketones to form. These ketones accumulate in the blood and spill into the urine.

Normally, insulin is produced in the pancreas. In Type 1 diabetes, people need outside sources of insulin to survive.

About 3 million people in the U.S. have Type 1 diabetes, says Dr. Guillermo Umpierrez, a professor of medicine in the division of endocrinology, metabolism and lipids at Emory University School of Medicine, and chief of diabetes and endocrinology at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta.

Diabetic ketoacidosis results from the significant or complete lack of insulin,"" Umpierrez says. ""Therefore, it's much more common in patients with Type 1 diabetes. In the United States, we believe about one-third of the patients with diabetic ketoacidosis have Type 2 diabetes and two-thirds have Type 1 diabetes.""

Patients with Type 2 diabetes can develop ketoacidosis when they have an infection, are under stress or are taking certain medications. Long-term, poorly controlled diabetes may be one of the most important risk factors for patients with Type 2 diabetes to develop DKA, Umpierrez says.

At its worst, DKA can be fatal. However, mortality is strongly related to precipitating causes. In someone who is newly diagnosed with diabetes, or who has stopped taking insulin and develops ketoacidosis, mortality is less than 1 percent, Umpierrez says. However, if DKA occurs in the context of a heart attack or other serious medical condition, that risk rises.

Onset of DKA

For people who don't know they have diabetes, the first DKA episode often leads to diagnosis. For those with known diabetes, DKA means blood sugar is spiraling out of control.

Blood sugar levels vary throughout the day. Fasting blood sugars, after waking and before eating, tend to be lower. A fasting blood sugar of less than 100 milligrams per deciliter is considered normal. A random blood glucose level of at least 200 mg/dL indicates diabetes.

With DKA, glucose usually surpasses 250 to 350. ""The average blood glucose in a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis is about 600 mg/dL – or six to eight times the normal blood glucose level in a nondiabetic person,"" Umpierrez says.

Early DKA Symptoms

To turn rising blood glucose levels around, patients must recognize early DKA symptoms:

Increased thirst.
Frequent urination.
Unexplained weight loss.
Fruity-smelling breath.
Nausea.
Fatigue.
High blood glucose.
Elevated urine ketones.
DKA Emergency

Health care providers need to be aware of these progressing DKA symptoms and signs of dehydration:

Abdominal pain and cramping.
Vomiting.
Decreased perspiration.
Cool, dry skin.
Behavior changes (not acting right).
Vision changes.
Confusion.
Lethargy.
DKA and Kids

DKA is highly dangerous for children, says Dr. Arleta Rewers, an associate professor of pediatrics-emergency medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and a physician at Children's Hospital Colorado. ""About 50 percent of kids who have DKA are admitted to the ICU,"" she says. ""They require very extensive treatment with fluids and insulin.""

Two basic scenarios bring children to the hospital, says Rewers, a contributor to the updated publication Diabetes in America from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The first is kids who are developing diabetes but aren't yet diagnosed, who suddenly begin showing symptoms.

In kids known to have diabetes, missed insulin treatments or brewing infections can predispose them to developing DKA. ""Also, kids on insulin pumps can have DKA,"" Rewers says. ""Sometimes there's a malfunction and it's not recognized early enough.""

Complications extend beyond the crisis. ""DKA also has long-term consequences,"" Rewers says. ""It changes brain development and brain functioning for a long time. Kids who had DKA can show memory and learning problems going on for several years.""

Once diabetes is diagnosed, DKA wipes out remaining insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, Rewers says, thus reducing any 'honeymoon period' and increasing kids' lifelong struggle with glucose control. ""It leaves a permanent mark on the child.""

Up to 1 percent of kids who come to the hospital with DKA may develop cerebral edema, or swelling in the brain, Rewers notes. Cerebral swelling can be fatal or leave the child with catastrophic health consequences.

Team Approach

Working closely with your endocrinologist, diabetes educator, dietitian and primary care provider will help you stay in control of diabetes and prevent DKA. Monitoring blood glucose is the most proactive way to prevent DKA, says Cara Schrager, a registered dietitian and certified diabetes educator at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston.

Continuous glucose monitoring systems, which are worn on the body, make it easier for users to know how their glucose is doing in the moment. CGM technology checks the wearer's glucose every few minutes. Most monitors also have trend arrows.

However, many people with diabetes continue to rely on traditional finger sticks to check their blood glucose throughout the day. For a longer-term measure of blood glucose control, health care providers regularly do a blood test called hemoglobin A1C. The A1C shows your average blood sugar level for the past three months or so.",11
11,"MICROSOFT WANTS RULES FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION—JUST NOT THESE

IN DECEMBER, MICROSOFT President Brad Smith urged lawmakers to set rules on facial-recognition technology to prevent a privacy-threatening “race to the bottom.” Now the company has joined a legislative fight in its home state against rules it says would be too restrictive.

Microsoft is pushing back on a bill sponsored by a bipartisan group of Washington state lawmakers that would ban local and state governments from using facial recognition until certain conditions are met, including a report by the state attorney general certifying that systems in use are equally accurate for people of differing races, skin tones, ethnicities, genders, or age.

Microsoft has endorsed a different bipartisan privacy bill, modeled on European data laws. It contains less restrictive facial-recognition rules, which closely mirror Smith’s proposals from December. It requires notices to be posted in public premises using facial recognition and requires government agencies to obtain a court order to watch for specific people in public, unless there is an emergency posing risk of serious injury.

That bill has its own opponents, including the ACLU, which drafted the moratorium bill, which also is supported by groups representing immigrants, Muslims, and criminal defense attorneys. Shankar Narayan, director of the technology and liberty project of the ACLU’s Washington chapter, says requiring public notice of face recognition won’t check its use, and he warns that authorities could use the “emergency” exception as a loophole. “Microsoft’s bill has us heading to a world where face surveillance is ubiquitous and the norm,” Narayan says.


Reuven Carlyle, a Democratic state senator and primary sponsor of the privacy bill preferred by Microsoft, counters that the state attorney general would quickly act if law enforcement tried to exploit the emergency provision, and he worries that the ACLU-backed bill would stifle innovation. “They want the default to be that you cannot use this technology,” he says. “I don’t believe in the premise of government deciding that a commercial application can or can’t be used.”

Microsoft declined to make anyone available Wednesday to discuss the bills. A company attorney, Natasha Crampton, spoke out against the moratorium bill at a legislative committee hearing earlier this month. “It puts in place a moratorium and restrictions on use that will in practice block many positive government uses of facial recognition technology,” Crampton said, a line that was echoed by a representative of the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs.

Committees in the Washington Legislature will determine the fate of the bills later this month.

The tussle among lawmakers, civil liberties groups, and the tech industry over whether and how to constrain facial-recognition technology in Washington state may be a preview of similar battles elsewhere in the world.

Lawmakers have taken notice as research reveals that image analysis and facial-recognition systems are often less accurate on black faces. That has refreshed long-established concerns about disadvantaging minorities and the surveillance potential of the technology.

A bipartisan bill in Massachusetts would halt use of facial recognition by state agencies pending the adoption of broader regulations on the technology. A San Francisco lawmaker has proposed banning city agencies from using the technology altogether. Senator Carlyle says citizens and companies are looking to states to address potentially harmful effects of technology. “Growing acknowledgement of the incompetence of the federal government has come into play, and people realize that the image of state governments as the laboratories of democracy is more meaningful than ever,” he says.

Microsoft is not the only company following the Washington debate. Carlyle says Amazon has suggested minor adjustments to the section of his bill related to facial recognition. Earlier this month the company issued its own call for new legislation on facial recognition. The company did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.

A representative of Axon, maker of Tasers and police body cameras, told lawmakers that the facial-recognition rules favored by Microsoft might inhibit its development of new technology to serve law enforcement. The company is working on artificial intelligence technology to process body camera footage.

Jevin West, who codirects the University of Washington’s DataLab, has not taken a position on either bill but says he is pleased to see issues around facial recognition being aired. “Having bills that force a conversation around regulations on this technology is a good idea,” he says.

West sees strengths and weaknesses in both bills. Law enforcement concerns about a moratorium without a fixed end date are understandable, given the uncertainty about how quickly the state government would or could perform the steps needed to end it, he says.

He also thinks technical institutions such as universities, with their expertise in AI technology and tricky research questions, could add teeth to a provision in Carlyle’s bill requiring facial-recognition systems to permit testing by outsiders. Microsoft previously suggested that Consumer Reports could perform the tests.",12
12,"5 Simple Online Security Tricks You Need to Protect Your Data

We live in an age of ever-growing cybersecurity threats. As the digital frontier has continued to expand, cybercriminals have continuously evolved their tactics in order to stay ahead of police and cybersecurity specialists. In many cases, they have succeeded.

2017 has the distinction of being the worst year in the history of cybercrime. There were over 160,000 attacks on companies and organizations all over the world. Businesses lost over $5 billion because of the attacks. What’s worse? Most of them were completely preventable.

It’s more critical than ever that you protect your online data, and you can start with these five easy tricks to make your personal info more secure.

It’s more critical than ever that you protect your online data, and you can start with these five easy tricks to make your personal info more secure.

online security tips to protect your data
1.   Disable the Save My Password/Credit Card Function
I get it. It’s a pain to have to type in your password each and every time you log on. It’s also tempting to save your credit data so you don’t have to whip out your wallet every time you make a purchase. But doing so opens your personal data to compromise and can lead to disaster.

Whatever browser you use, always disable these features before you start surfing. The time you spend retyping your password and credit card info is more than worth the time you’ll save trying to put your life back together if you get hacked.

2.   Upgrade Your Password to Make it More Complex
That’s right: not only do I want you to make you type your password each time, but I also want your password to be more complex. The reason is that simple passwords are much easier to crack than complex ones. It makes them hard to remember, but it will improve your security.

Some tips you should follow include:

Aim for 12 to 20 characters
Use varying combinations of capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
Avoid using birthdays, pet names, favorite bands, and any other information that’s commonly known about you
Use a different password for each and every site
3.   Set Up a VPN
Even if you didn’t know it, certain pieces of information about your browsing habits are public information. This includes the sites you’ve been on, the searches you’ve done, and any products you’ve browsed. Police and security organizations use this data to track cyber criminals. Businesses use it to send you ads. Hackers use it to steal your identity.

Anytime you’re online, especially if you’re using a public Wi-Fi network, you need to use a VPN. A VPN is a private network that routes your browsing data through a server, encrypts it, and then sends it onto the net. It makes it nearly impossible to see where the data came from, and what it says.

Setting up a VPN isn’t difficult, and one can be installed on nearly any device.

4.    Get Anti-Virus Software and Keep it Updated
If you don’t have anti-virus software, your computer’s security may already be compromised, and you don’t even know it. Trojan viruses are often embedded in normal software and infect your computer after your download is complete. Trojans are commonly found in free software such as:

Videos
ROMs
Music files
The scary thing about Trojans is that they won’t change the way your computer behaves. You’ll think everything is fine, but as you type, the virus is tracking your passwords, banking PINs, and network security keys.

The only way to keep Trojans and other malware off of your computer is with good anti-virus software. My personal recommendation is Norton, which is pricey, but by far the best on the market. Once you’ve got it, keep it updated. There were over 30,000 new variations of viruses that sprang up in 2017, according to CNET. As viruses evolve, so should your anti-virus.

5.   Clear Your Browser Cache Once a Month
As you surf the Internet, your browser is creating a history of where you’ve been, what you’ve looked at, and what you’ve typed. Websites use cookies to remember your preferences, including passwords, advertisement preferences, and search strings. This makes it easy to revisit your favorite sites but also makes it easier to steal your data.

At least once a month, take the time to clear out your browser cache and clear your cookies. This does mean you’ll need to reenter your preferences each and every time, but it will bolster your defenses against cybercriminals.",13
13,"Kick Your Bad Habits
Well, some of them at least. The other ones you might just be able to cut back on. Habits in the ""quit"" category would be smoking, drugs, unsafe sex and other unhealthy addictions. There's just no way to do any of these in a ""healthy"" way. It might take some time, but it's worth it if you want to lead a healthy lifestyle. On the other hand, there are some habits that are not so bad, but can easily become a problem if taken too far. These include alcohol, sugar, caffeine and junk food. These things in moderation or on a ""once-in-a-while"" basis are doable, as long as the majority of your choices are mindful and healthful.

Get Your Checkups
Get to your doctor for your annual physical just to make sure everything is as it should be. If you have insurance, usually these services are covered, so take full advantage of your benefits. That being said, know your own body so that you are aware when something seems awry. Do breast or testicular self-exams, and get suspicious moles checked out. Get exams regularly even if you are healthy, so that if and when something is abnormal, you know about it and can take action, in conjunction with your doctor.

Sleep
Sleep affects our physical and mental health tremendously, and many of us do not get enough. Lack of sleep adversely affects metabolism, mood, concentration, memory, motor skills, stress hormones and even the immune system and cardiovascular health. Sleep allows the body to heal, repair and rejuvenate itself in a way it simply cannot when a person is awake.

Exercise

Even if you just get out for a walk a few times a week, exercise is important for being fit and healthy. Cardiovascular exercise helps to strengthen the heart and lungs, strength training helps to strengthen the muscles and stretching helps to reduce the risk of injury by increasing flexibility. Exercise also improves circulation and body awareness, and regular exercise can help combat depression.

Eat Healthfully

Get as many fresh fruits, vegetables,and whole grains into your diet as possible and make them the main part of your overall diet. Include lean sources of protein such as poultry, fish, tofu and beans. Eat balanced meals and do not overeat. Stop eating before you become completely full and give yourself a chance to digest your food. Snack on whole foods such as fruit, vegetables and nuts. Avoid highly processed foods that contain artificial sweeteners or colors, hidden sugars or excessive fat.

Eat Breakfast Each Day
A healthy breakfast starts your day off right. It sets you up so that you have energy and fuel for optimal mental and physical performance. Eating breakfast helps to maintain stable blood sugar levels and a healthy weight because you are less likely to overindulge later in the day.

Drink Water
Our bodies are made mostly of water. Most fluids and foods contain water that will help to keep our bodies hydrated, but fresh, clean, plain water is still the best and healthiest beverage for maintaining a healthy body. It is the most natural cleanser for our organs and digestive system. Being hydrated is crucial for the brain as well as for helping to flush toxins out through the skin (perspiration) and urine.

Reduce Stress
Stress can cause a myriad of problems, from heart trouble to digestive problems. This should not come as a surprise. What many people do not know is what to do about it, how to manage their stress. Exercise, meditation, doing what you love, appropriate boundaries, spirituality, being in nature, and enjoyable hobbies all help alleviate the harmful effects of stress on the body. Don't overwork. Take breaks (vacations, mini-vacations, days off) and surround yourself with people who support you.

Express Yourself
Keeping emotions bottled up inside can cause mental and emotional stress as well as physical symptoms. Unexpressed feelings can lead to depression, sleep problems, eating disorders, and even physical pain. Learn to talk about your feelings, or express them through some sort of art. Even writing thoughts and feelings down is a good way to express things you find hard to say.",14
14,"Weedkiller Chemical Found in Popular Beer and Wine
By Kathleen Doheny

Feb. 25, 2019 -- The next time you enjoy a glass of wine or a mug of beer, chances are you’re also drinking pesticide.

All but one of 20 alcoholic beverages analyzed in a recent study by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) had detectable levels of the pesticide glyphosate, says Kara Cook, the author of the study and PIRG's toxics program director. The pesticide is best known as the key ingredient in the weedkiller Roundup.
""The levels we found are not in themselves dangerous,"" Cook says. ""They are well below the EPA tolerance levels. I wouldn't tell somebody, 'Don't drink beer or wine.' ''
The pesticide is also found in many foods, used in gardens, and present in rainwater, Cook says. ""What we don't know is what the cumulative effect of all these exposures are over a lifetime.""
Cook says they are trying to raise awareness among consumers. The report concluded that the Environmental Protection Agency should ban glyphosate ''unless and until it can be proven safe,"" due to what the group says is more evidence that it causes cancer. Residues may show up in beer if the pesticide is used on barley, for instance, and in wine if growers spray the weeds near grapevines.
The group issued the report, ""Bottoms Up: Glyphosate pesticide in beer and wine,"" today.
William Reeves, PhD, a toxicologist for Bayer, which owns Monsanto, the maker of Roundup, takes exception to the report's findings and recommendations. In a statement, he says the PIRG “is publicizing misleading information about pesticide residues in food.""
Reeves takes issue with some of the research, including the method the researchers used to measure the levels of pesticide in the beverages, which he says is not acceptable for use with any source other than water.
He says a 125-pound person would need to drink a large amount of wine a day for life to reach the EPA tolerable limit for people.

Evaluating the Samples
For the report, the PIRG researchers tested five wines, 14 beers, and one hard cider for the presence of glyphosate. The amount detected ranged from a high of 51 parts per billion (ppb) in a Sutter Home wine to no detectable levels in Peak Organic IPA beer.
To put those numbers in perspective, the EPA sets allowable glyphosate residues on more than 150 different food and feed crops (but not a limit on beer or wine), and it ranges from 0.2 to 400 ppm -- or 200 to 400,000 ppb.
In a statement, the Wine Institute, an advocacy group for the California wine industry, says the study included just five wines, and ''the study acknowledges that the amounts [of pesticide] found are low.""
The Beer Institute, a national trade association, said in a statement that: ""Our members work with farmers who go to great lengths to raise their crops sustainably and safely. The federal government tests a variety of commodities for glyphosate regularly, and the results of the most recent federal testing showed farmers' use of glyphosate falls well below federal limits.”
From highest to lowest levels of the pesticide, here is how the samples fared:

One surprise, Cook says, is that even though weedkillers aren’t allowed to be used when making organic beers and wines, their testing found the pesticide in three of the four organic beverages analyzed.

Does Glyphosate Cause Cancer?
On its webpage, the EPA says that glyphosate products can be safely used if label directions are followed and that it has ''low toxicity for humans.""
Some research by the World Health Organization linked glyphosate with cancer, but another report did not, Cook notes in the report.
In recent years, some communities have banned its use. And in 2018, a jury in California ordered Monsanto to pay $289 million to a groundskeeper who says the pesticide caused his cancer.
This report comes on the same day a San Francisco court begins hearing arguments in the first federal civil case over whether Roundup weedkiller causes cancer.",15
15,"How Does Stress Harm Your Health?

We all experience stress, to some degree, in our daily life. From work to busy schedules, from important relationships to our goals and dreams, we have competing priorities and it's a lot to keep on top of. But while a limited amount of stress is normal, and even healthy, continuous or severe stress can be very harmful to your physical and mental health. Because all stress isn't the same and different types of stress affect us in ways that are somewhat unique, it helps to understand the different types of stress and how to best manage each, so you can tackle stress in the most effective ways.

Types of Stress
Stress can be defined as any type of change that causes physical, emotional or psychological strain. However, not all types of stress are harmful or even negative. There are a few different types of stress that we encounter:

Eustress, a type of stress that is fun and exciting, and keeps us energized. This is the kind of stress we associate with surges of adrenaline, such as when you are skiing or racing to meet a deadline.
Acute Stress, a very short-term type of stress that can either be positive or more distressing. This is the type of stress we most often encounter in day-to-day life.
Episodic Acute Stress, where acute stress seems to run rampant and be a way of life, creating a life of relative chaos.
Chronic Stress, the type of stress that seems never-ending and inescapable, like the stress of a bad marriage or an extremely taxing job.
Stress and the Flight-or-Flight Response
Stress can trigger the body’s response to perceived threat or danger, the Fight-or-Flight response. During this reaction, certain hormones like adrenalin and cortisol are released, speeding the heart rate, slowing digestion, shunting blood flow to major muscle groups, and changing various other autonomic nervous functions, giving the body a burst of energy and strength. Originally named for its ability to enable us to physically fight or run away when faced with danger, it’s now activated in situations where neither response is appropriate, like in traffic or during a stressful day at work. When the perceived threat is gone, systems are designed to return to normal function via the relaxation response, but in our times of chronic stress, this often doesn’t happen enough, causing damage to the body.

The Impact on Your Health
When faced with chronic stress and an over-activated autonomic nervous system, people begin to see a negative impact on their health. The first symptoms are relatively mild, like chronic headaches and increased susceptibility to colds. With more exposure to chronic stress, however, more serious health problems may develop. These stress-influenced conditions include, but are not limited to:

depression
diabetes
hair loss
heart disease
hyperthyroidism
obesity
obsessive-compulsive or anxiety disorder
sexual dysfunction
tooth and gum disease
ulcers
The effects of stress impact us emotionally as well, which is a truth both obvious and often ignored. While some stress may produce feelings of mild anxiety or frustration, prolonged stress can lead to burnout, anxiety disorders, and depression. A study of stress in America by the American Psychological Association shows that a large proportion of people (roughly one-quarter of respondents) feel their stress levels are harmful to their physical and emotional health and feel they aren't doing enough to manage the stress.

While short-term stress is usually harmless, prolonged stress can have serious implications for your health. If you are battling stress and are beginning to show physical symptoms, consult with your doctor about ways to manage your stress levels in a healthy way.

What You Can Do

To keep stress, especially chronic stress, from damaging your health, it’s important to be sure that your body does not experience excessive states of this physiological arousal. There are two important ways to do this:

Learn Tension-Taming Techniques: Certain techniques can activate your body’s relaxation response, putting your body in a calm state. These techniques, including meditation, yoga, deep breathing exercises, journaling, positive imagery, and others, and can be learned easily and practiced when you’re under stress, helping you feel better relatively quickly.",16
16,"The Most-Efficient, Easiest Way to Clean Your Bathroom
Learn how to make quick work out of cleaning your bathroom, and get tips on the best solutions to use on fixtures, faucets and walls.


Considering what we put them through each day, sinks, showers, tubs and toilets deserve special cleaning attention. Thankfully, modern plumbing fixtures are designed to make the job of bathroom cleaning as easy as possible.

We asked home-efficiency expert Cynthia Townley Ewer, author of Houseworks, to explain the best way to clean and disinfect bathroom fixtures.

Sinks
From toothpaste dribbles to overspray from hair products, the lowly sink endures a daily barrage of dirt and grime. Keep it sparkling back at you with regular cleaning.

Right for the job. Use all-purpose bathroom cleaner to remove light soil and film. For more hardened deposits, abrasive or soft-scrub cleaners may be used, as they will be easy to rinse from ceramic (vitreous china) surfaces. Cleaners formulated with bleach will remove toothpaste dribbles and sanitize surfaces, too. Keep bathroom cleaning green by using homemade cleaners. They'll make your bathroom sparkle and shine without harsh chemicals — or a harsh price tag.



On the edge. Clean the rim and fixtures with a disinfecting spray glass cleaner or all-purpose bathroom cleaner. Buff fixtures shiny and dry with a fresh cleaning cloth.

Shower and Tub
Soap scum, bath oil, hair products and body soil combine forces to assault the shining surface of the shower and tub, while tub rims, fixtures and faucets provide hiding places for moisture, mold and mildew. Put the job off and deposits harden and ossify, and mildew and mold take up residence in dark corners. Harness time and cleaning power to make short work of cleaning the shower and tub.

Spray and stand. Before cleaning the rest of the bathroom, spray the tub area with a generous layer of all-purpose bathroom cleaner, and allow the product to stand while you clean elsewhere. The standing time helps the cleanser to dissolve oils and soap scum, so you'll need less elbow grease to remove it.

Get scrubbing. Use abrasive scrubbing pads to remove bathtub rings or deposits on shower floors. Tile brushes scrub tile grout and reach into cracks and corners, while the handle protects knuckles from accidental contact with the tub. A cleaning toothbrush does a quick job of removing buildup deposits around tub fixtures or faucet.

Rinse clean. A detachable showerhead allows you to rinse off cleaner quickly and cleanly. If you don't have one, stock your cleaning tote with a removable rubber showerhead that attaches to the bathtub tap. Commonly used for shampooing hair or bathing pets, they're inexpensive and make it easier to rinse tub and shower walls after you clean.

Fiberglass Showers and Glass Doors
These surfaces need special treatment. Clean them with a nonabrasive cleaner such as an all-purpose bathroom cleaner, pine oil or baking soda. Avoid abrasive cleansers or scrubbing pads because they may scratch or dull the finish.

Cloudy glass shower doors may be cleaned with full-strength white vinegar or a commercial lime and scale remover. Use good ventilation and protect skin and clothing when using these products.

Toilet
Cleaning the toilet isn't most people's idea of a good time, but where would we be without it? I'll tell you: back in the outhouse. Try these ideas to keep it clean and inviting:

Take your time. Place granulated or liquid toilet bowl cleaner into the bowl, and let the cleaner go to work. Standing time is necessary to dissolve deposits and kill germs, so don't cut the time short.

Brush up. A good bowl brush is a must. If yours is flattened or mashed, replace it; you need those bristles bristling to do a good job. Curved bowl brushes reach up and under the toilet rim to scour away hidden deposits.

Scrub up. If the toilet develops a stubborn ring that regular cleaning won't cure, bring on the pumice stone! This natural stone is porous and crumbles. Rub the stone directly on the ring to remove the deposit.

Disinfect. Use a disinfecting spray cleaner or all-purpose bathroom cleaner to spray toilet rims, seat and lid, tank and bowl exterior. Be sure to check the label for the recommended standing time; antibacterial cleaning products require a certain amount of wet exposure to kill germs. Wipe clean and dry with fresh cleaning cloths.

Drips and dribbles. These are a predictable hazard in a home containing boys — of any age — and can cause odor problems and floor damage if urine is allowed to stand at the base of the toilet. Use disinfecting cleaner and the cleaning toothbrush to rout out stray dribbles — or assign the job to the manly offenders.",17
17,"Step by Step Potty Training Tips
by Lawrence Kutner, Ph.D.
Potty training is one of the major accomplishments of early childhood. But before your child can master it, he has to be both biologically and emotionallyready. Different children are ready at different ages; the timing has nothing to do with their intelligence, personality, or motivation.

Potty training involves putting together a set of individual skills in a certain order, such as being able to interpret the signals your body is givingyou, undressing, having some control over your bowels and bladder, and washing your hands. Your child should have at least some of these skills masteredbefore starting potty training, or you'll both become frustrated.

Here are three steps that can help your child maximize his success.

1.Preparation

Get a potty chair. Many children feel more secure starting with one that sits on the floor rather than one that sits on top of the toilet. It's lessscary, and it gives them the security and balance that comes with being able to put their feet securely on the floor.
Put the potty chair in a place that's convenient to where your child spends most of his time. It doesn't have to be in the bathroom; you could keep itin a corner of your playroom. Ease of access is important in the beginning.
Let your child explore the potty chair and become familiar with it. Let him know that it's special and it's just for him.
2.Learning

Have your child practice sitting on the potty with her clothes on once or twice a day. Let her get up whenever she wants. Your goal is to help her become comfortable with it.
Praise your child for each step, even the small ones and the ones that aren't completely successful. Stay upbeat. Remember that this is her accomplishment, not yours.
Once she's comfortable sitting on the potty with her clothes on, have her practice sitting on it with her clothes off. This helps her get familiar withthe concept of removing her clothes before going to the bathroom. It also lets her feel what the seat is like next to her skin.
After a few days, when your child has a bowel movement in her diaper, have her watch you dump it into the potty so that she can see where it should go.Explain to her that this is where urine and stool belong. (Children this age are also mastering the idea that certain things go in certain places.)
Look for signs that your child needs to urinate or move her bowels. Some children will tell you in so many words. Others will grimace or grunt or get into a particular position. When that happens, ask her if she needs to go.
Let your child see you sitting on the toilet. Let her sit on her potty chair at the same time, if it's in the bathroom. It's easier for boys if they first learn to urinate while sitting down. If they begin by standing up, sometimes they'll resist sitting down to have a bowel movement; it's too confusing.",18
18,"Running with an Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Exercising with IBD has added challenges, but it's doable – and recommended.
The day he ran the Walt Disney World Marathon, Todd Snider's alarm went off at 1:30 a.m. Groggy, he dragged himself to the hotel bathroom, where he more or less remained on the toilet for the next two hours. Only then was he ready to do what other racers were just rising to do: things like eat bananas, drink electrolyte-rich fluids, lace up shoes and head to the start line. Needless to say, ""it made for a long day,"" says Snider, a 48-year-old elementary school teacher in Eatonton, Georgia.
Snider has ulcerative colitis, a chronic autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and subsequent sores or ulcers in the lining of the colon (also known as the large intestine). The condition is an inflammatory bowel disease and can cause stomach pain, bleeding and frequent, urgent bowel movements. While UC is limited to the colon, the other main inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, can involve inflammation in any part of the gastrointestinal tract and result in similar symptoms – stomach cramps and pain, urgent and frequent diarrhea, rectal bleeding and fatigue.
While the conditions can be managed with medications, lifestyle modifications and in some cases surgery, there is no cure and the symptoms often set in and dissipate in unanticipated waves. As a result, people with IBD tend to adjust their daily lives and even careers to account for bathroom proximity. One study even showed that about a quarter of employed people with IBD were on sick leave and almost as many received a disability pension. Nearly 80 percent said their condition contributed to a ""low working pace."" In other words, the disease affects patients' social, mental and physical well-being, says Katie Taylor, an assistant professor of exercise science at Eastern Washington University in Cheney, Washington, who studies physical activity in people with inflammatory bowel diseases.
It can also affect their willingness to exercise: Research suggests about one-third of people exercise less after an IBD diagnosis. People with IBD may be particularly reluctant to take up running, a sport known to trigger digestive issues, aka ""runner's trots,"" even in runners with the healthiest of GI tracts, thanks to its repetitive, pounding motion. ""Certain types of physical activity can really have more of a negative impact on the gut itself,"" Taylor says.
For Snider, running with colitis isn't a burden, it's ""freedom,"" he says. ""UC can take a day or two away from me from time to time,"" he says, ""but on the days I'm not in a flare, I want to do whatever anyone else is doing – and I can."" He and others share their tips on lacing up if you have IBD:

Find community.

Dewey Thom was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis at age 14 and didn't run until about age 40. The turning point came when the investor and retired stock broker in San Francisco saw a Crohn's & Colitis Foundation brochure advertising its ""Team Challenge"" program, which promised to provide patients like him the coaching and support to complete a half-marathon in exchange for fundraising. ""In my mind, it was like, 'All right, I'm going to get to the start line, cross the finish line, raise the money and follow through on what I said I was going to do … and be done (with running),"" he remembers.
That didn't happen. Since then, Thom estimates he's completed about 30 half-marathons and has finished two marathons – almost all with and because of Team Challenge. ""In that environment, you're automatically supported by definition,"" he says. ""You don't have to do it on your own.""

Work with pros, if possible.

Working with a coach or trainer can be especially helpful for people with chronic diseases – if you feel comfortable telling him or her all about your disease, medications (if any), diet and IBD-induced challenges. It's important to connect that person with your doctor, too. ""That's what coaches are there for: They don't want to just tell you to run faster, they want to help you solve a problem,"" Walton says. ""Whether your challenge is IBD or a prosthetic leg, we're going to work with you to get results as much as we can.""

For example, he may help runners with IBD develop a less-jarring running stride, adjust a running route to be closer to bathrooms or experiment with their nutrition. What you don't want to do, Walton says, is avoid eating or drinking prior to a long workout in an attempt to avoid a flare mid-workout. ""That's not sustainable,"" he says.
Prepare.

When possible, Snider runs in the afternoons when he's typically emptied his bowels enough to exercise most comfortably. On race days, he rises earlier than most and packs wipes. ""I've jumped in the bushes a handful of times and am so thankful I run prepared,"" says Snider, who's on a prescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that pretty effectively prevents flares and makes his bathroom schedule relatively predictable. ""I don't see it as coping, I guess, but just my normal life.""

For Thom – who has a ""J-pouch,"" or an internal reservoir for stool surgically created from the small bowel, since his colon was removed – needing to go on the run isn't typically a problem. ""What running does sometimes for me is it allows me not to focus on the bathroom,"" he says. His challenges, however, are overcoming IBD-related fatigue in order to train, and staying hydrated enough. Because he doesn't have a colon, which absorbs water, dehydration is a particularly real threat that's led to race-halting cramps in the past.

No matter what your IBD-related barriers to running are, identifying them and preparing accordingly is critical. For instance, if you're someone who does need to use the bathroom hourly (or even more frequently), run in a loop by a bathroom or on a treadmill at gym with a bathroom you feel comfortable in, Walton says. ""A lot of the challenge of an endurance sport is the discipline that you're instilling in your schedule and life to achieve a goal, and it carries over into this type of situation as well,"" Walton says.
Keep at it.

Like IBD itself, your relationship with running and exercise in general will have its ups and downs. ""There will be a little bit of trial and error, but don't get disheartened,"" Taylor says. If you decide running isn't for you, try something less intense before building up to a higher intensity again, she suggests. ""Cycling is phenomenal exercise because you remove that mechanical stress,"" she says. Walking is a great option too, especially if you can do it with friends who will hold you accountable. But really, any type of movement you enjoy will pay off not just in IBD management, but also mental health, disease prevention and longevity.

The point is to keep moving in spite of your condition. As Thom tells other people with IBD interested in joining Team Challenge, but who are worried that they can't complete a long race, ""I know you can, the question is, do you think you can? If you think you can, you can. ... It's a function of being willing to try.""",19
19,"Mods/Installing mods using ModLoader
Before the player decide to modify their copy of Minecraft, it is very important to understand what they are doing or they may end up messing up with the copy. (If your copy of Minecraft is compromised, you can always backup your worlds and re-download Minecraft) If you mod Minecraft, you may break your copy of the game as well as any worlds that you play in. Because you are doing something that is wholly unsupported by Mojang, they won't be able to help you.

Due to how modding works, updating the Minecraft client will break your mods. That is, with each update of the Minecraft client, you will have to obtain updated mods and re-install them. However, the worlds you created will not be destroyed (although any mod items in your world will not be present).

Additionally, the authors of the mod make no guarantees as to whether or not the code works, much less any guarantees of support.

Nearly all mod packs have auto-installers that make adding mods to Minecraft extremely easy for the beginner Modder. You can search for mod packs on the Mods page.

Installation Tools and Prerequisites
Before installing any mod, read the entire description provided by the mod author, as these will sometimes contain special instructions necessary to ensure the mod installs correctly. Further, be aware that while installing mods, certain combinations will present conflicts, which is what occurs when a mod does not work well with another mod due to overwrites or edits that are incompatible. Mod authors will sometimes include specific mods that have known conflicts in their descriptions, but generally common sense may be utilized, for example, a texture mod will likely conflict with another texture mod that edits the same objects. If you experience a bug and have determined that it is unique to your mod setup, it is recommended to submit a detailed bug report to the author of the mod.

Mods typically come packed in compressed files, which means you will need a tool to handle these files such as WinRAR, 7-Zip, or another equivalent tool. Alternatively, Forge or MCPatcher are installation tools that can assist with the installation process.

If your copy of Minecraft breaks, then you should seek help from somebody in the modding community (preferably the mod author).

How Mods Work
A .jar file on the versions folder under .minecraft provides everything Minecraft needs to be able to run. When you add mods to Minecraft, you are taking the .jar file and over-writing it with the changes needed. All of these files inside run through a process called obfuscation.

Furthermore, everything in the game (mobs, items, blocks, etc.) has an ID which allows the game to differentiate each of them. As new content is added to Minecraft, new IDs are used.

This is fundamentally changing the way Minecraft was meant to be played. So Mojang will not be able to help you in any way, and are not responsible for crashes, data loss, etc.
Some mods might claim to do something, but could in fact have been authored with a malicious intent such as stealing your Minecraft username/password, or install a keylogger. This is only a concern if:
The mod that you download contains an executable and you run it.
The mod that you download informs you that you should modify the Minecraft launcher.
If the mod that you wish to install involves neither of these actions then you should feel quite secure. If not, a good measure of safety is to only install mods from a secure and safe website. Make sure to read the comments on mod posts before downloading and installing.",20
20,"Android 101: how to organize your home screen
You’ve got several methods to choose from
By Barbara Krasnoff Mar 6, 2019, 11:11am EST

If you’ve had an Android phone for any length of time, it’s easy to get used to living with, well, chaos. If you’re anything like me, you’re constantly adding new apps, deciding they’re okay but not great, adding another, and so on. Then, a few months later, as you’re scrolling through your app drawer, you’re surprised to see several apps that you forgot about and perhaps don’t even remember what they’re used for.

In a very short time, it can become a mess. And if you’re really an app enthusiast, it can start taking up more space than you can spare. (Here, we can take as written the obligatory KonMari reference.)

There are essentially two steps to making sense of all of those Android apps: find a way to organize them (and there are a variety of ways, depending on what you’re comfortable with) and periodically remove all of the extra apps that you’ve accumulated and no longer use. Here are a few tips to help you do both. If you’re new to Android, this may help you stay organized from day one; if you’re an experienced user, you might pick up a few tips.

As you go through these suggestions, keep in mind that not all Android interfaces are the same. This how-to was created using a Pixel 3 XL running Android 9 Pie, but your interface may be slightly different, depending on the model of your phone and which Android version you’re running.
Get organized

At the most basic (and anyone who’s had an Android phone for more than a week or two can skip down a bit), you can just use the app drawer, which is accessed either by swiping up from the bottom of the phone or by pressing on the apps icon at the bottom center of your display. Place the apps you use the most on one or more of your home screens by long-pressing them while in the app drawer.

The app drawer is (thankfully) organized in alphabetical order, with your four last-used apps on top. You can swipe up to go through the apps; you can also swipe down on the side to go through the alphabet (which could be faster). A search bar at the top lets you type in the name of your app if you wish.

However, once you start accumulating apps, you may want to save some time by creating a more structured system.
Fill the Favorites Tray

You can quickly access your most-used apps by putting them Favorites Tray, the bottom row of apps that is always there no matter which home screen you’ve swiped to. The tray is already filled? No problem.

    Long-press on the app you no longer want to keep in the Favorites Tray. Move it to another place on the home page, or move it up until you see the Remove and Uninstall choices at top of the screen. Choose one and move the app there.
    Long-press on an app from the home screen or from the app drawer, and move it into the tray.

Create folders on your home screen

A good way to organize your apps is to use folders. For example, you can put all of your music and podcast apps into a folder called “Listen,” or all your social media apps into a folder called “Social.” It’s simple to create a folder.


    Put the first two apps you want to include on your home screen.
    Long-press one and move it on top of another. This will create a new folder.
    Give the folder a name: tap on the folder, tap on the name just below the apps, and type in your new name.
    Add more apps to a folder by long-pressing on the app and moving it into the folder.
    Remove an app from a folder by reversing that process: long-press on the app and move it from the folder to the home page.",21
21,"A Man May Be Cleared of HIV for the Second Time in History. Here's What That Means

A man in London has become only the second person to achieve remission from HIV infection, researchers from the UK reported. The therapy responsible has worked on only one other person who is considered to be “cured” of HIV: Timothy Brown, who still does not show signs of the virus in his body after more than 10 years.

Here’s what to know about the landmark case.

How did it happen?
In a letter published in the journal Nature, researchers led by Ravindra Gupta from the University of Cambridge London and Imperial College London and his colleagues say that they used a treatment similar to the one Brown received in 2007, but with a few changes meant to make the therapy easier and less intense for the patient. The London patient, who wishes to remain anonymous, was diagnosed with HIV in 2003 but did not begin anti-HIV drug therapy, which can keep the virus below detectable levels, until 2012. That year, he was also diagnosed with stage 4 Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

To treat his cancer, he received chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant in 2016; the chemotherapy killed the malignant and healthy cells in his immune system and blood, while the transplant gave him a fresh start with bone marrow cells from a healthy donor, which seeded a new population of cancer-free immune and blood cells. Brown had received two similar transplants to treat his leukemia; his donors were intentionally chosen because they not only matched him, but they also harbored genetic mutations that made their cells nearly impervious to HIV infection. These mutations are in a gene called CCR5, which HIV normally recognizes in immune cells and uses like a key to enter and infect them. But with the mutated CCR5, Brown’s immune cells became molecular fortresses that HIV couldn’t penetrate — which meant the transplant essentially cured him of his infection.

For the London patient, Gupta and his team also found a donor who had these mutations in CCR5. The patient remained on anti-HIV drugs to prevent the virus from replicating for nearly 1.5 years after the transplant; because HIV tends to hide in cells in a dormant phase and reactivate years later, Gupta wanted to be sure that as much of the virus as possible was destroyed with the drugs. Then in 2017, Gupta took the London patient off of the anti-HIV drugs to see if the transplant had worked as it had in Brown’s case: to push the HIV into remission. Indeed, 16 months later, his virus remains at below detectable levels, and his immune cells all contain the HIV-fighting CCR5 mutation.

Does this mean HIV has been cured?
It’s a matter of semantics, says Dr. Steven Deeks, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco and one of the doctors who treated Brown. “Is that a cure? I think so.” He says he believes that some HIV still remains in the London patient’s body, but that because his immune system is now impervious to the virus, the HIV is marooned — like a castaway on a remote island who cannot swim. Because it’s a virus, it can’t replicate on its own, but instead needs to co-opt the machinery of another cell in order to reproduce, so it can only replicate when it infects other cells. But if HIV is surrounded by a sea of CCR5-mutated cells that it can’t exploit, it’s stymied.

“Personally I think there is probably some virus somewhere in the body, but it’s absolutely trapped,” says Deeks. “It may persist there for quite some time, but who cares? It can’t grow, it can’t replicate, it can’t spread — it can’t cause any problems.”

Still, HIV has proven before to be a wily shapeshifter, and except for Brown, people who previously went in remission for various reasons for a year or so have always seen their virus start to replicate again. Even a newborn girl in Mississippi, who was treated with anti-HIV drugs minutes after being born to an HIV-positive mother and remained in remission for about four years without medications, saw her HIV return and needed to go back on drug therapy.",22
22,"Apple Car rumors still in drive, Project Titan said to focus on electric van and battery research

A rumor today from German publication Manager Magazin, shares some alleged details about a shift in Apple’s Project Titan. While Apple’s car efforts were originally expected to include the company manufacturing its own vehicle, it reportedly later changed course to just focusing on developing autonomous vehicle software. However, today’s rumor suggests that Apple is working on its own electric van.

Based on the information received from anonymous sources, Manager Magazin believes Apple has “breathe[d] new life into its plans for a self-developed electric vehicle.” Translated from German:

the Apple Car could come in the form of an electric van. Apple’s engineers have designed specimens with black and silver paint, designed in the typical industrial design of the iPhone group. Apple also researches on its own batteries, electric motors, special seats and interior components.

The report also references Doug Field returning to Apple after spending a few years at Tesla as a sign that Apple has shifted back to producing its own vehicle.

However, even if this information is indeed true, there could be another explanation for Apple engineers designing an electric van outside of it planning to produce the vehicle at scale.

Notably, The New York Times piece that reported Apple shifting its Project Titan focus to just developing autonomous vehicle software noted that the company would be testing an autonomous vehicle as an employee shuttle. A van or minibus would make sense for that application.

Apple is creating an autonomous vehicle to ferry employees from building to building called PAIL or Palo Alto Infinite Loop that will be a test bed for its autonomous software.

While Apple CEO Tim Cook hasn’t shared anything definitive, he did mention that the company is focusing on autonomous systems back in 2017.

There is a major disruption looming there […] We’re focusing on autonomous systems, and clearly one purpose of autonomous systems is self-driving cars. There are others, and we sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects. It’s probably one of the most difficult AI projects actually to work on. And so autonomy is something that’s incredibly exciting for us.

However, if true, the detail from Manager Magazin about Apple researching electric vehicle batteries and other components like motors would be curious if it’s not planning on manufacturing vehicles. Another possibility could be the company making its own prototypes for its employee transportation testing without planning to bring the vehicle to consumers.

But if Apple is actually working on an electric van intended for mass production, it could follow in the steps of Google’s Waymo who launched its autonomous ride service in Phoenix, Arizona last December.

23,"How to use an eGPU with a Mac
Apple has often been criticized for the limited upgrade options that are available in the various Mac and MacBook models, and some models don’t even allow you to upgrade the memory or storage, let alone improve performance by installing a new graphics card.

However, the high-speed Thunderbolt 3 interface that is now used in the latest Macs and MacBooks does allow you to boost your Mac’s graphics performance by connecting it to an ‘eGPU’ – or ‘external-GPU’ – that actually sits outside the Mac itself.

An eGPU is simply an empty box – called an ‘enclosure’ – that contains a PCI expansion slot for a graphics card and a power supply to drive the card. The enclosure will also have a Thunderbolt 3 port for connecting it to your Mac (and most eGPUs are also compatible with Windows PCs that have Thunderbolt 3 as well).

There are several companies that make eGPU enclosures, with the Core X enclosure that we use in this guide having been loaned to us by the kindly gaming gurus at Razer.

The one drawback with buying an empty enclosure such as this is that you also need to buy and install the graphics card yourself, so bear that in mind when calculating the combined cost of the eGPU enclosure and graphics card together.

There are a handful of eGPU models that do include a pre-installed graphics card, but these aren’t much cheaper than the DIY option that we look at here, and do limit your choice of graphics card as well.

Check out our list of the best graphics cards for inspiration
1. What you need
Apple’s guidelines for using an eGPU state that you need a Mac that is equipped with Thunderbolt 3, and running High Sierra (macOS 10.13.4) or later.

But even the entry-level Mac mini has Thunderbolt 3 now, so this is a great way of upgrading less expensive Mac models, or a lightweight laptop such as the MacBook Air.

However, there is one other important limitation that you need to bear in mind. Apple and nVidia don’t seem to get along for some reason, so the macOS itself currently only works with graphics cards from AMD, such as the Radeon RX 570 loaned to us by Razer along with the Core X enclosure.

2. Core values
The Core X is one of the more affordable eGPU enclosures currently available, costing £260/$300/AU$469.

It’s primarily designed for use with laptops, but there’s no reason why you can’t use it with a desktop Mac if you want. Just remember that most eGPU enclosures are sold without a graphics card, so you still have to provide the graphics card yourself.

That adds to the overall cost of your graphics upgrade – but the use of the external enclosure provides a terrific upgrade that wouldn’t normally be available for a laptop computer, or a small-form-factor machine like the Mac mini.

3. Installing the graphics card
When you open up the Core X enclosure you’ll see the PCI slot for installing your shiny new graphics card, along with the bulky black power supply box, cooling fan, and power cables that connect to your awesome new graphics card.

Some high-end graphics cards need a lot of power, so before buying any eGPU enclosure you should check to make sure that its internal power supply provides enough power for the graphics card that you intend to use.

And, rather handily, Razer’s Core X also provides enough power to charge a laptop via its USB-C connector as well.",24

We live in an age of ever-growing cybersecurity threats. As the digital frontier has continued to expand, cybercriminals have continuously evolved their tactics in order to stay ahead of police and cybersecurity specialists. In many cases, they have succeeded.

2017 has the distinction of being the worst year in the history of cybercrime. There were over 160,000 attacks on companies and organizations all over the world. Businesses lost over $5 billion because of the attacks. What’s worse? Most of them were completely preventable.

It’s more critical than ever that you protect your online data, and you can start with these five easy tricks to make your personal info more secure.
We live in an age of ever-growing cybersecurity threats. As the digital frontier has continued to expand, cybercriminals have continuously evolved their tactics in order to stay ahead of police and cybersecurity specialists. In many cases, they have succeeded.

2017 has the distinction of being the worst year in the history of cybercrime. There were over 160,000 attacks on companies and organizations all over the world. Businesses lost over $5 billion because of the attacks. What’s worse? Most of them were completely preventable.

It’s more critical than ever that you protect your online data, and you can start with these five easy tricks to make your personal info more secure.

online security tips to protect your data
1.   Disable the Save My Password/Credit Card Function
I get it. It’s a pain to have to type in your password each and every time you log on. It’s also tempting to save your credit data so you don’t have to whip out your wallet every time you make a purchase. But doing so opens your personal data to compromise and can lead to disaster.

Whatever browser you use, always disable these features before you start surfing. The time you spend retyping your password and credit card info is more than worth the time you’ll save trying to put your life back together if you get hacked.

2.   Upgrade Your Password to Make it More Complex
That’s right: not only do I want you to make you type your password each time, but I also want your password to be more complex. The reason is that simple passwords are much easier to crack than complex ones. It makes them hard to remember, but it will improve your security.

Some tips you should follow include:

Aim for 12 to 20 characters
Use varying combinations of capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
Avoid using birthdays, pet names, favorite bands, and any other information that’s commonly known about you
Use a different password for each and every site
3.   Set Up a VPN
Even if you didn’t know it, certain pieces of information about your browsing habits are public information. This includes the sites you’ve been on, the searches you’ve done, and any products you’ve browsed. Police and security organizations use this data to track cyber criminals. Businesses use it to send you ads. Hackers use it to steal your identity.

Anytime you’re online, especially if you’re using a public Wi-Fi network, you need to use a VPN. A VPN is a private network that routes your browsing data through a server, encrypts it, and then sends it onto the net. It makes it nearly impossible to see where the data came from, and what it says.

Setting up a VPN isn’t difficult, and one can be installed on nearly any device.

4.    Get Anti-Virus Software and Keep it Updated
If you don’t have anti-virus software, your computer’s security may already be compromised, and you don’t even know it. Trojan viruses are often embedded in normal software and infect your computer after your download is complete. Trojans are commonly found in free software such as:

Videos
ROMs
Music files
The scary thing about Trojans is that they won’t change the way your computer behaves. You’ll think everything is fine, but as you type, the virus is tracking your passwords, banking PINs, and network security keys.

The only way to keep Trojans and other malware off of your computer is with good anti-virus software. My personal recommendation is Norton, which is pricey, but by far the best on the market. Once you’ve got it, keep it updated. There were over 30,000 new variations of viruses that sprang up in 2017, according to CNET. As viruses evolve, so should your anti-virus.

5.   Clear Your Browser Cache Once a Month
As you surf the Internet, your browser is creating a history of where you’ve been, what you’ve looked at, and what you’ve typed. Websites use cookies to remember your preferences, including passwords, advertisement preferences, and search strings. This makes it easy to revisit your favorite sites but also makes it easier to steal your data.

At least once a month, take the time to clear out your browser cache and clear your cookies. This does mean you’ll need to reenter your preferences each and every time, but it will bolster your defenses against cybercriminals.",25
25,"Wi-Fi 6: is it really that much faster?

Wi-Fi is about to get faster. That’s great news: faster internet is constantly in demand, especially as we consume more bandwidth-demanding apps, games, and videos with our laptops and phones.

But the next generation of Wi-Fi, known as Wi-Fi 6, isn’t just a simple speed boost. Its impact will be more nuanced, and we’re likely to see its benefits more and more over time.
WHAT MAKES WI-FI 6 FASTER?
There are two key technologies speeding up Wi-Fi 6 connections: MU-MIMO and OFDMA.

MU-MIMO, which stands for “multi-user, multiple input, multiple output,” is already in use in modern routers and devices, but Wi-Fi 6 upgrades it.

The technology allows a router to talk with multiple devices at the same time, rather than starting with one device, and then the next, and the next. Right now, MU-MIMO allows routers to talk with four devices at a time. Wi-Fi 6 will allow devices to talk with up to eight.
In practice, this is all used to get more out of every transmission that carries a Wi-Fi signal from a router to your device.

WI-FI 6 CAN ALSO IMPROVE BATTERY LIFE
Another new technology in Wi-Fi 6 allows devices to plan out communications with a router, reducing the amount of time they need to keep their antennas powered on to transmit and search for signals. That means less drain on batteries and improved battery life in turn.

This is all possible because of a feature called Target Wake Time, which lets routers schedule check-in times with devices.

It isn’t going to be helpful across the board, though. Your laptop needs constant internet access, so it’s unlikely to make heavy use of this feature (except, perhaps, when it moves into a sleep state).

Instead, this feature is meant more for smaller, already low-power Wi-Fi devices that just need to update their status every now and then. (Think small sensors placed around a home to monitor things like leaks or smart home devices that sit unused most of the day.)",26
26,"Intermittent fasting boosts health by strengthening daily rhythms

Various versions of the intermittent fasting diet appear to have weight loss benefits. A new study investigating why they work concludes that circadian rhythms are key.

While the modern world appears awash with fad diets, people seem to be giving a fair bit of attention to intermittent fasting.

As its name implies, intermittent fasting involves eating nothing for extended periods of time.

Some studies have found that this type of diet is beneficial, but exactly why it benefits health is not yet clear.

Recently, a group of scientists at the University of California, Irvine investigated the impact of fasting on our circadian clock.

Daily sleep–wake cycles, or circadian rhythms, drive the ebb and flow of human life; they control much more than just our sleepiness levels. Our 24-hour cycles involve metabolic, physiological, and behavioral changes that impact every tissue of the body.

Perhaps the most well-known way to influence the clock is via exposure to bright lights, but this isn't the only way; food intake also impacts the clock.

We are slowly beginning to understand how eating plays a role in modulating circadian rhythms, but we know even less about how a lack of food might affect rhythms.

Fasting and circadian rhythms
The authors of the new study were particularly interested in learning about how fasting influenced circadian rhythms in the liver and skeletal muscles. The researchers published their findings in the journal Cell Reports.

Fasting is a natural phenomenon for most animals, because food is not always readily available. In times of hardship, certain metabolic changes occur to allow the body to adapt.

According to a recent study, the 16:8 fasting diet could help people with obesity lose weight and lower their blood pressure.
For instance, when glucose is scarce, the liver begins to create ketones from fatty acids, which the body can use as an emergency energy source.

A host of fasting-induced transcription factors drive these metabolic changes. These transcription factors also seem to influence circadian rhythms.

As an example, one study split mice into two groups; the researchers put one on an intermittent fasting regime, and they allowed the second to eat whenever it liked.

Both groups consumed the same amount of fat and calories; however, despite having the same energy intake, mice in the fasting group did not develop obesity or metabolic disorders as the other mice did.

Also, importantly, the authors noted that the animals' circadian oscillations were more robust in the fasting group.

As the authors of the recent study point out, ""[F]asting appears to be a strong metabolic cue to entrain rhythmic gene expression.""

Scientists believe that having more clearly defined cycles might be part of the reason that fasting promotes good health.

Rhythmic fasting genes
The most recent study also involved mice. While the animals adhered to 24-hour periods of fasting, the scientists measured various physiological functions.

They saw that while fasting, mice used less oxygen and energy. However, as soon as the mice ate, these gene-driven physiological changs were reversed. This mirrors what researchers have previously seen in humans.

Lead study author Prof. Paolo Sassone-Corsi explains what the researchers found, saying, ""We discovered [that] fasting influences the circadian clock and fasting-driven cellular responses, which together work to achieve fasting-specific temporal gene regulation.""

They also note that it influenced different tissue types to different degrees. As Prof. Sassone-Corsi says, ""Skeletal muscle, for example, appears to be twice as responsive to fasting as the liver.""

How might this benefit us?
Having assessed the gene changes that occur with fasting, the scientists now need to explain how they might benefit health.

Prof. Sassone-Corsi suggests that ""the reorganization of gene regulation by fasting could prime the genome to a more permissive state to anticipate upcoming food intake and thereby drive a new rhythmic cycle of gene expression.""

He adds, ""In other words, fasting is able to essentially reprogram a variety of cellular responses. Therefore, optimal fasting in a timed manner would be strategic to positively affect cellular functions and ultimately benefitting health and protecting against aging-associated diseases.""

Over the years, it has grown increasingly clear that disrupting circadian rhythms can increase the risk of obesity and metabolic disorders, such as diabetes. Though understanding the influence of fasting on circadian rhythms and gene expression is still in its infancy, the authors hope that one day, their work will help find the optimum fasting regime.",27
27,"How-To Diagnose an Ingrown Toenail

Common Causes of an Ingrown Toenail
Some of the most common causes of an ingrown toenail include: (4)

Wearing shoes that crowd the toenails, such as heels or any shoes that are too tight (this is the No. 1 risk factor for ingrown toenails, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS))
Cutting toenails too short or not straight across
Injuring the toenail
Having unusually curved toenails
Toe deformities
Subungual exostosis (outgrowth of bone from the tip of the toe)
Use of isotretinoin in the treatment of severe acne

There are many risk factors involved in the development of ingrown nails, such as anatomic and behavioral mechanisms. Some experts suggest that wider nail folds and thinner, flatter nails may increase the risk of ingrown toenails. A case-control study with 46 patients found no difference in the anatomic shape of toenails in patients with and without ingrown toenails. (5)

Repetitive trauma, such as running, kicking or inadvertent trauma like stubbing the toe, may be other ingrown toenail causes. Without any strict evidence basis, it’s thought that a genetic predisposition and family history, hyperhidrosis, and poor foot hygiene increase the likelihood of ingrown toenails. Diabetes, obesity, thyroid, cardiac and renal disorders that may predispose to lower extremity edema can also increase the likelihood.

In adolescence, feet perspire more often, causing the skin and nails to become soft, resulting in easy splitting. This produces nail spicules (sharp points that of the nail) that can pierce the lateral skin. In older persons, spicule formation can become a chronic problem caused by their reduced ability to care for their nails, secondary to reduced mobility or impaired vision. In addition, the natural aging process causes toenails to thicken, making them more difficult to cut and more inclined to exert pressure on the lateral skin at the sides of the nail plate, often becoming ingrown, painful and infected.

According to a 2005 Cochrane Review, rates of regrowth after treatment were 34 percent to 50 percent. In 1959, Vandenbos and Bowers noted that patients who developed this nail problem tend to have an excessive amount of tissue at the sides of the affected nail. They theorized that weight-bearing caused the tissue to bulge over the sides of the nail, which can result in the growth of the toenail into the skin. (6)

I want to note that an ingrown fingernail is similar in terms of how it happens. The usual causes of ingrown fingernails are due to improper trimming of the nail, an injury and even nail biting. And, like the toenail, sometimes the natural shape or thickness of the nail can make it more susceptible to becoming ingrown. (7)

Whatever the cause, and regardless as to whether it’s an ingrown toenail or ingrown fingernail, it can be incredibly annoying to excruciatingly painful. And if left untreated, it can become infected.

By avoiding or minimizing some of these risk factors, it may be possible to prevent ingrown toenails.

Medical Treatment of Ingrown Toenails
Once your ingrown toenail has progressed past the first stage, you may need to seek medical help. There are various surgical treatments of ingrown toenails your podiatrist may recommend. All of these are standard, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS).

Wedge Resection: This involves the partial removal of the nail or a portion of it, after numbing your toe with a local anesthetic and draining any ingrown toenail infection. Your doctor can perform this procedure in the office and the recovery time is anywhere between two weeks to two months, depending on the size of the nail portion removed.

Matrixectomy: The matrixectomy procedure is also referred to as permanent or full nail avulsion. Unlike typical avulsions, which aren’t often practiced anymore (they often result in further issues), a matrixectomy happens when the physician removes the entire nail from your nail bed and then covers the nail matrix (the tissue beneath your nail) with a chemical that stops it from ever growing back.

Vandenbos Procedure: The Vandenbos procedure has been around since the late 1950s and involves removal of the skin directly underneath and on either side of the ingrown toenail. Recovery is longer with this procedure, but this is also the only procedure in which a doctor does not need to prescribe antibiotics for prevention of infections. It also seems to be the procedure most likely to prevent recurrences of ingrown nails.

Risks, Complications and Things You Should Know About Ingrown Toenails
It’s also important to note that if you have diabetes or another condition that causes poor blood flow to your feet, you’re at greater risk of complications of ingrown toenails. (8) That’s just another reason to treat your diabetes.

Left untreated or undetected, an ingrown toenail can infect the underlying bone and lead to a serious bone infection. Complications can be especially severe if you have diabetes, which can cause poor blood flow and damage nerves in your feet. So a minor foot injury — a cut, scrape, corn, callus or ingrown toenail — may not heal properly and become infected.

A difficult-to-heal open sore (foot ulcer) may require surgery to prevent the decay and death of tissue (gangrene). Gangrene results from an interruption in blood flow to an area of your body. (9)

Other Diseases Affecting the Toenails
While ingrown toenails are the most common foot ailment, there are various foot diseases that cause nail problems and often have to be ruled out before diagnosing ingrown toenails.

Lichen Planus: Lichen planus, or “LP,” is a form of dermatitis that causes skin lesions on the foot (and sometimes other regions of the body). In about 10 percent of cases, toenails are affected, causing ridging and grooving, splitting, nail thinning and eventually, nail loss. (10)

Alopecia Areata: While most people think of alopecia in terms of hair loss, the impact it has on nails is sometimes the first sign of the disease. Within this disease, offending nails become pitted or split, frequently causing a rough appearance and white spots. (11)

Onychomycosis: This fungal infection of the fingernails or toenails might involve any part of the nail (matrix, bed or plate). Onychomycosis can cause pain/discomfort and even disfigurement, and the progression of the disease may result in problems with standing, walking and exercising. The foot complications involved with onychomycosis are also frequently responsible for causing social and professional limitations to those afflicted. (12)

Final Thoughts on Ingrown Toenails
An ingrown toenail, or onychocryptosis, may occur at any age and is one of the most common toenail problems. It can be a painful condition that can become infected if not properly cared for. Ingrown toenails usually affect the big toe, though other toes can also be affected.
Ingrown toenails are classified into three categories: mild (stage 1), moderate (stage 2) and severe (stage 3). Mild cases are characterized by nail-fold swelling, erythema, edema and pain with pressure. Moderate cases are associated with increased swelling, drainage, infection and ulceration of the nail fold. The most severe cases of ingrown toenail exhibit chronic inflammation and granulation, as well as marked nail-fold hypertrophy.
Some of the most common causes of an ingrown toenail include wearing shoes that crowd the toenails, such as heels or any shoes that are too tight, cutting toenails too short or not straight across, injuring the toenail, having unusually curved toenails, toe deformities, subungual exostosis (outgrowth of bone from the tip of the toe), and use of isotretinoin in the treatment of severe acne.
Ingrown toenail symptoms include pain and tenderness in your toe along one or both sides of the nail, redness around your toenail, swelling of your toe around the nail, and infection of the tissue around your toenail.
To get rid of an ingrown toenail at home, you can soak or wash the foot, wash with Castile soap, try an apple cider vinegar wash, use dental floss under the nail, avoid high heels and tight shoes, and use essentials oils to help reduce inflammation and pain.",28
28,"How to Setup Your Own Personal Cloud Storage

For those folks who don’t trust their data in the cloud, the best storage solution is usually local, meaning either an external hard drive or a computer. The advantage to this solution is that you don’t have to pay any money to store your data (other than purchasing the drives) and you don’t have to worry about someone else being able to get into your data (for the most part).

However, there are several disadvantages to storing everything locally on internal and external hard drives. Firstly, unless you have a good backup solution in place, you are more at risk of losing your data. Cloud storage companies have many redundant layers of backup to protect all your data.

Secondly, it can be really difficult and frustrating to access data stored on a single external hard drive from anywhere in the world on any device. Cloud storage services usually make this really easy by having desktop apps and mobile apps for accessing data.

If you want the advantages of cloud storage, but the security of having everything locally stored, you should consider setting up personal cloud storage. Again, you’ll get all the mobile and desktop apps and everything will be synced, but you’ll have the data stored locally on your own devices.

Again, you’ll have no monthly fees to worry about, but you’ll have a higher up-front cost. Personal cloud storage is also really good for anyone who has terabytes of data they need to store, but don’t want to pay the hefty monthly costs associated with anything over 1 TB. For example, after the 1 TB plan on Google Drive, it skips to 10 TB and you have to spend $99 a month.

With OneDrive, you can only add more space after 1 TB in 50 GB increments. Each 50 GB increment costs $1.99. To get to 10 TB, you’d have to pay a whopping $360 a month! With Dropbox, you can only get a max of 1 TB with a Pro account. If you want more than that, you need to become a business customer with at least 5 users.

Understanding Network Hard Drives
So what do you need to buy in order to get your own cloud storage setup? Well, you’re basically buying a network attached storage device or NAS. Note that a NAS device is slightly different than a network hard drive.

In my view, a network hard drive is a single hard drive inside a device that connects to the network and provides a web interface to control and access data. A NAS has multiple hard drives that can be configured in a RAID array, thereby providing in-built data protection.

I recommend staying away from single network hard drive solutions because it’s pretty much the same thing as using a regular external hard drive, except you get all the cloud features. However, if the drive fails, you lose all your data, which may or may not be duplicated somewhere else.

For example, if you consider the WD My Cloud Personal NAS, the single drive is really just a network hard drive. If you get the dual drive version, then it can be considered a NAS in my opinion.

As you can see, though, you can get 8 TB worth of storage for about $400, which is not bad at all. Of course, there is one caveat to consider. The reason I suggest a NAS device with two or more hard drives is for data protection. If you put your drives into a RAID array, one drive can fail and you won’t lose any data.

All of the devices mentioned here support RAID on the NAS devices and it’s actually really easy to setup. The only issue is that you lose some available space. For example, if you take the 8 TB NAS above and use RAID 1, you’ll only have 4 TB of free space. If you use RAID 5, you’ll need at least 3 drives, but will get two-thirds of the total space of all three drives.

Considering you can get a dual drive 16 TB NAS for around $750, even being left with 8 TB is probably way more than enough for even creative professionals.

Other Benefits of a NAS

Beyond the personal cloud benefits and being able to sync your data across all your different devices, NAS devices provide a lot of other benefits. Not every device I mention below supports all of these features, except for Synolgy, so be sure to check the features on the device you are considering.

Data protection when using a mutli-bay NAS with RAID
Ability to locally and remotely stream videos from NAS to games consoles, set-top boxes, smartphones and tablets
Ability to connect IP cameras to NAS for video surveillance and recordings
Ability to backup local computers (Windows, Mac, Linux) to the NAS
Ability to backup entire NAS to online cloud storage services like Amazon S3, Glacier, etc.
Ability to use your NAS a FTP server, web server, mail server, etc. with the use of apps
Ability to share files and folders easily with anyone
As you can see, the benefits of having a NAS are much more than just having your own personal cloud storage. You can do a lot with these devices, which makes the up-front cost more bearable.

Personal Cloud Storage Solutions
So which NAS should you get? Well, when it comes to cloud storage, what you are really looking for is great software. All the major hard drive vendors have NAS devices with some sort of personal cloud option, but only a few work really well and have a suite of apps to manage the cloud data.

Synology
I personally have a WD My Cloud EX2 Ultra and a Synology DS 411+II and I find the Synology to be an absolutely amazing device. My Synology NAS is several years old, but can still be updated to the latest version of DSM (DiskStation Manager). The software running on the NAS is excellent and is almost like using Windows.",29
29,"Google Employees Uncover Ongoing Work on Censored China Search
Ryan Gallagher

Google employees have carried out their own investigation into the company’s plan to launch a censored search engine for China and say they are concerned that development of the project remains ongoing, The Intercept can reveal.
Late last year, bosses moved engineers away from working on the controversial project, known as Dragonfly, and said that there were no current plans to launch it. However, a group of employees at the company was unsatisfied with the lack of information from leadership on the issue — and took matters into their own hands.
The group has identified ongoing work on a batch of code that is associated with the China search engine, according to three Google sources. The development has stoked anger inside Google offices, where many of the company’s 88,000 workforce previously protested against plans to launch the search engine, which was designed to censor broad categories of information associated with human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest.
In December, The Intercept reported that an internal dispute and political pressure on Google had stopped development of Dragonfly. Google bosses had originally planned to launch it between January and April of this year. But they changed course after the outcry over the plan and indicated to employees who were working on the project that it was being shelved.
Google’s Caesar Sengupta, an executive with a leadership role on Dragonfly, told engineers and others who were working on the censored search engine in mid-December that they would be allocated new projects funded by different “cost centers” of the company’s budget. In a message marked “confidential – do not forward,” which has been newly obtained by The Intercept, Sengupta told the Dragonfly workers:
    Over the past few quarters, we have tackled different aspects of what search would look like in China. While we’ve made progress in our understanding of the market and user needs, many unknowns remain and currently we have no plans to launch.
    Back in July we said at our all hands that we did not feel we could make much progress right now. Since then, many people have effectively rolled off the project while others have been working on adjacent areas such as improving our Chinese language capabilities that also benefit users globally. Thank you for all of your hard work here.
    As we finalize business planning for 2019, our priority is for you to be productive and have clear objectives, so we have started to align cost centers to better reflect what people are actually working on.
    Thanks again — and your leads will follow up with you on next steps.
Sources with knowledge of Dragonfly said staff who were working on the project were not told to immediately cease their efforts. Rather, they were instructed to finish up the jobs they were doing and then they would be allocated new work on other teams. Some of those who were working on Dragonfly were moved into different areas, focusing on projects related to Google’s search services in India, Indonesia, Russia, the Middle East, and Brazil.
But Google executives, including CEO Sundar Pichai, refused both publicly and privately to completely rule out launching the censored search engine in the future. This led a group of concerned employees — who were themselves not directly involved with Dragonfly — to closely monitor the company’s internal systems for information about the project and circulate their findings on an internal messaging list.
The employees have been keeping tabs on repositories of code that are stored on Google’s computers, which they say is linked to Dragonfly. The code was created for two smartphone search apps — named Maotai and Longfei — that Google planned to roll out in China for users of Android and iOS mobile devices.
The employees identified about 500 changes to the code in December, and more than 400 changes to the code between January and February of this year, which they believe indicates continued development of aspects of Dragonfly. (Since August 2017, the number of code changes has varied between about 150 to 500 each month, one source said.) The employees say there are still some 100 workers allocated to the “cost center” associated with Dragonfly, meaning that the company is maintaining a budget for potential ongoing work on the plan.
Google sources with knowledge of Dragonfly said that the code changes could possibly be attributed to employees who have continued this year to wrap up aspects of the work they were doing to develop the Chinese search platform.
“I still believe the project is dead, but we’re still waiting for a declaration from Google that censorship is unacceptable and that they will not collaborate with governments in the oppression of their people,” said one source familiar with Dragonfly.
The lack of clarity from management has resulted in Google losing skilled engineers and developers. In recent months, several Google employees have resigned in part due to Dragonfly and leadership’s handling of the project. The Intercept knows of six staff at the company, including two in senior positions, who have quit since December, and three others who are planning to follow them out the door.
Colin McMillen, who worked as a software engineer at Google for nine years, quit the company in early February. He told The Intercept that he had been concerned about Dragonfly and other “ethically dubious” decisions, such as Google’s multimillion-dollar severance packages for executives accused of sexual harassment.
Prior to leaving the company, McMillen said he and his colleagues had “strong indications that something is still happening” with Google search in China. But they were left confused about the status of the China plan because upper management would not discuss it.
“I just don’t know where the leadership is coming from anymore,” he said. “They have really closed down communication and become significantly less transparent.”
In 2006, Google launched a censored search engine in China, but stopped operating the service in the country in 2010, taking a clear anti-censorship position. At the time, Google co-founder Sergey Brin declared that he wanted to show that the company was “opposing censorship and speaking out for the freedom of political dissent.”
Pichai, Google’s CEO since 2015, has taken a different position. He has a strong desire to launch search again in China — viewing the censorship as a worthwhile trade-off to gain access to the country’s more than 800 million internet users — and he may now be waiting for the controversy around Dragonfly to die down before quietly resurrecting the plan.
“Right now it feels unlaunchable, but I don’t think they are canceling outright,” McMillen said. “I think they are putting it on the back burner and are going to try it again in a year or two with a different code name or approach.”",30
30,"Luke Perry’s death is reminder stroke ‘is not only a disease of the elderly,’ doctor says
By Madeline Farber | Fox News

Actor Luke Perry's tragic death on Monday following a ""massive stroke"" at age 52 has physicians warning that the disease affects more than just the elderly.

""Although stroke often affects older individuals, it is not only a disease of the elderly. Luke Perry's tragic death highlights the fact that stroke can affect middle-aged and young adults, even children,” Mitchell S.V. Elkind, the chair of the American Stroke Association Advisory Committee, which is a division of the American Heart Association, said in a statement Monday. “In fact, there is evidence that stroke rates among young people are increasing in the United States and this requires additional research.”
While it's not clear what type of stroke the beloved ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" star suffered, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says nearly 90 percent of all strokes are ischemic strokes, or when a blood clot prevents blood flow to the brain. Though the risk of suffering a stroke typically increases with age, a 2013 study found that roughly 15 percent of all ischemic stroke “occur in young adults and adolescents.”

A stroke can also occur when a blood vessel ruptures and blocks blood flow to the brain. This is known as a hemorrhagic stroke.

“While we don't know the cause of Perry's stroke, it's important for people to know the risk factors for stroke,” Elkind added.

These risk factors typically include smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity and  “other cardiovascular diseases such as atrial fibrillation,” the association said in the statement. Face drooping, arm weakness and speech difficulties are all signs of a stroke, which is the second-leading cause of death worldwide.
Maintaining a healthy diet and weight, staying active, limiting alcohol intake and not smoking are all ways to prevent a stroke, according to the CDC.
Perry isn’t the only celebrity who suffered a stroke at a younger-than-expected age. At just 20 years old, “Parks and Recreation” star Aubrey Plaza, now 34, also had a stroke, telling the Guardian in 2016 it caused her to lose her ability to speak for a period of time.

“Things take on a different meaning when death comes so close,” she said at the time.
Perry, who recently played Archie Andrews’ father Fred on the hit teen drama “Riverdale,” died less than a week after he suffered a stroke at his California home and was transported to a hospital.

""He was surrounded by his children Jack and Sophie, fiancé Wendy Madison Bauer, ex-wife Minnie Sharp, mother Ann Bennett, step-father Steve Bennett, brother Tom Perry, sister Amy Coder, and other close family and friends,"" a rep for Perry told Fox News following his death. ""The family appreciates the outpouring of support and prayers that have been extended to Luke from around the world, and respectfully request privacy in this time of great mourning. No further details will be released at this time.""",31
31,"Exclusive: Google's Duplex could make Assistant the most lifelike AI yet

he conversation seems mundane. At least, at first.

In a building called the Partnerplex on Google's sprawling campus in Mountain View, California, I've been invited to hear a 51-second phone recording of someone making a dinner reservation.

Person 1: Good evening.
Person 2: Hello?
Person 1: Hello.
Person 2: Hi, um, I'd like to reserve a table for Friday the third.
Person 1: OK, hold on one moment.
Person 2: Mm hmm.
Person 1: OK… hold on one second.
Person 2: Mm hmm.
Person 1: So Friday November third. How many people?
Person 2: For... two people.
Person 1: Two people?
Person 2: Yeah.

As I listen to what sounds like a man and a woman talking, Google's top executives for Assistant, the search giant's digital helper, watch closely to gauge my reaction. They're showing off the Assistant's new tricks a few days before Google I/O, the company's annual developer conference that starts Tuesday.

Turns out this particular trick is pretty wild.

That's because Person 2, the one who sounds like a man, isn't a person at all. It's the Google Assistant. And it (Or ""he""? That's its own debate.) doesn't sound at all like the semirobotic, disembodied voice you usually hear out of a Google Home smart speaker when it's giving you updates on the weather or telling you how long it'll take you to commute to work. (You can hear the Assistant's conversations for yourself in the video below.)



This could be the next evolution of the Assistant, Google's rival to Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana. It sounds remarkably -- maybe even eerily -- human, pausing before responding to questions and using verbal tics, like ""um"" and ""uh."" It says ""mm hmm"" as if it's nodding in agreement. It elongates certain words as though it's buying time to think of an answer, even though its responses are instantaneously programmed by algorithms.

With this new speaking ability, Google Assistant gets that much closer to hitting a milestone in the evolution of computing: passing the Turing test. Proposed by English computer scientist Alan Turing in 1950, it's a way of potentially evaluating a machine's ability to demonstrate intelligent behavior. To pass the Turing test, a computer's natural language responses would have to sound just like a human's.

Built with technology Google calls ""Duplex"" -- and developed by engineers and product designers in Tel Aviv, New York and Mountain View -- the AI sounds as though the future of voice assistants has arrived.

Well, almost arrived.

The demo is part of what Google calls an ""experiment"" it plans to launch this summer. With Duplex, a ""small"" number of people will be able to book restaurant reservations and hair appointments and to check holiday hours, stuff you'd normally do over the phone. All of that back-and-forth happens on the back end -- between Google Assistant and, say, the restaurant. You won't even hear the voice chat taking place. It'll come from an unspecified phone number, not your own.

Google is coy about the size of the rollout, but says it'll be limited -- all the company will say is it won't be available to everyone using Assistant today. Nick Fox, vice president of product and design for Google Assistant and Search, and Yossi Matias, Google's vice president of engineering, say the search giant wants to ""proceed with caution"" because it's such a new technology.

Google also won't say if its goal is to bring this natural-sounding Assistant to more products, like hearing it come out of your Google Home.

Here's how the reservation feature works: Say you want to book a haircut appointment. Just ask the Assistant from your Google Home, or text it from your Android phone or iPhone app, telling it where and when. If you want something at noon on Sunday, the Assistant will ask you for backup options just in case that time slot isn't available -- it knows that getting a range between, say, noon and 2 p.m. may be the smarter way to go.

If the business uses an automated online booking service like OpenTable, the Assistant will default to using that system for the appointment. But if the business doesn't take automated reservations that way -- and many small businesses don't -- Google's helper will make the call for you. The Assistant will text you back confirming your appointment and add it to your calendar.

In a different recorded conversation, I hear two female voices setting up a hair appointment. One is the Duplex technology. ""She"" sounds naturally human. She even does that thing with her voice that annoys some people, where her inflection goes up at the end of a sentence, even when not asking a question.

""We think of it as, 'What's a perfect assistant?'"" says Fox, a 15-year Google veteran. ""When I want an assistant with me, it's there. It's always ready to help. I don't worry about 'Can my assistant do it or not'? My assistant can do anything I want it to do.""

Fox, who's spent most of his time at Google working on search ads, is now in charge of product for one of Google's landmark projects. It's been almost exactly two years since Google announced the Assistant at I/O 2016. At the time, CEO Sundar Pichai sat down with CNET and explained his vision: The Assistant is the essence of Google, set free from the search box on the company's iconic, sparse homepage.

The goal for Pichai and his team is to have Google's artificial intelligence work alongside you as you go about your day: With the Assistant today, you can get morning news headlines from your Google Home, point your phone's camera at a flower to discover what species it is or turn up your thermostat so the house is a comfortable temperature when you get home.

But if Google's experiment becomes reality, the Assistant will truly be your digital assistant. ""Think of it as building your own individual Google,"" Pichai told us two years ago.

But as impressive as the Duplex phone recording is, we have to take the company's word for it. Google declined to do a live demo of the call during my briefing.

In the meantime, Google is trying to win more users with an updated Assistant that speaks in six new voices beyond the one female and one male it already has. The company is also making it easier for you to ask follow-up questions, and do things like send someone your ETA when you're driving and using Google Maps.

That personal touch
If the goal is for the Assistant to be Google personified, it still has a lot of evolving to do.",32
